# Milestone v2.0: Post-Processing + Robustness

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-02
**Phases:** 8-10
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

Produce RAG-ready text output from academic PDFs with robust operational behavior, structured logging, and async MCP support.

## Phases

### Phase 8: Robustness

**Goal**: Pipeline operates reliably with observable diagnostics -- worker logs reach the console, environment problems surface before processing starts, work directories clean up, and runaway files get timed out.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first v2.0 phase)
**Requirements**: ROBU-01, ROBU-02, ROBU-03, ROBU-04, ROBU-05, ROBU-06, ROBU-07, ROBU-08
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User sees log output from worker processes during parallel OCR runs on macOS
  2. User gets a clear error at startup when tesseract binary or required language packs are missing
  3. Work directory is automatically removed after successful processing; `--keep-intermediates` preserves it
  4. A corrupted or slow PDF times out instead of hanging the entire pipeline
  5. User can inspect per-worker log files after a parallel run to diagnose failures
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Multiprocess logging infrastructure (QueueHandler/QueueListener, per-worker log files)
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — Environment validation and startup diagnostics
- [x] 08-03-PLAN.md — Full traceback capture in all error paths
- [x] 08-04-PLAN.md — Pipeline integration (logging, cleanup, timeout, CLI flags)

### Phase 9: Post-Processing

**Goal**: OCR text output is RAG-ready -- paragraphs are joined, hyphens resolved, unicode unified, punctuation cleaned -- without destroying academic content like philosophical terms, author names, or Greek transliterations.
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (structured logging needed for debugging transforms in workers)
**Requirements**: POST-01, POST-02, POST-03, POST-04, POST-05, POST-06, POST-07
**Success Criteria**:
  1. Extracted text uses consistent Unicode NFC form with ligatures decomposed and soft hyphens removed
  2. Paragraphs are joined into continuous text while paragraph boundaries preserved
  3. Words split across lines with hyphens are rejoined; German compounds and French names keep their intentional hyphens
  4. Punctuation is normalized -- extra whitespace around punctuation collapsed, double spaces removed
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — TDD: postprocess.py module (unicode, paragraphs, dehyphenation, punctuation)
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — Integrate postprocess into pipeline text output

### Phase 10: Output and MCP

**Goal**: Pipeline results are available in structured formats for programmatic consumers -- JSON metadata alongside PDFs, text extraction via CLI flag, and async MCP handling for long-running jobs.
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (JSON metadata includes post-processing status; MCP wraps complete pipeline)
**Requirements**: OUTP-01, OUTP-02, OUTP-03, OUTP-04, OUTP-05
**Success Criteria**:
  1. A JSON file is written alongside each output PDF containing per-page quality scores, engine provenance, and processing stats
  2. `ocr --extract-text` produces a post-processed .txt file alongside the searchable PDF
  3. `ocr --json` outputs structured JSON results to stdout
  4. MCP `ocr_async()` returns a job ID immediately; `ocr_status(job_id)` reports progress and retrieves results when done
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — JSON metadata files, --extract-text, --json CLI flags
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — MCP async job handling (ocr_async/ocr_status) and progress reporting

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- POST-ORDER: dehyphenate runs before join_paragraphs (needs newlines for pattern matching)
- LOG-001: Use multiprocessing.Queue with QueueHandler/QueueListener pattern (fork+logging broken on macOS)
- Collect all environment problems before raising (user sees every issue at once)
- extract_text uses pipeline's .txt output files (preserves post-processing transforms)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Silent error swallowing in except blocks (full tracebacks now captured everywhere)
- macOS fork+logging incompatibility (queue-based transport)
- MCP extract_text was re-extracting text from PDF, losing post-processing (now uses pipeline .txt files)
- f-string logger calls replaced with %-formatting for lazy evaluation

**Issues Deferred:**

- test_callbacks.py import error (pre-existing, references removed ExtendedResult)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None identified in milestone audit
