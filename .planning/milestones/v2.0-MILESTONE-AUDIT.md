## Phase Verification

| Phase | Status | Score |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 8: Robustness | ✓ Passed | 18/18 must-haves |
| 9: Post-Processing | ✓ Passed | 14/14 must-haves |
| 10: Output and MCP | ✓ Passed | 16/16 must-haves |

## Cross-Phase Integration

All 12 cross-phase exports properly wired. No orphaned exports, no missing connections.

- Phase 8 logging used by pipeline workers (phases 9-10)
- Phase 9 postprocess called at all 3 text output points before Phase 10 metadata
- Phase 10 extract_text uses pipeline's post-processed .txt (not re-extracted)
- MCP async jobs use full pipeline including robustness and post-processing
- CLI flags from all 3 phases compatible: --extract-text --json --keep-intermediates --timeout

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| CLI OCR with text extraction | ✓ Complete |
| CLI JSON output | ✓ Complete |
| MCP sync with progress | ✓ Complete |
| MCP async flow | ✓ Complete |
| Robustness flow | ✓ Complete |
| Post-processing chain | ✓ Complete |

## Tech Debt

None identified across phases 8-10.
