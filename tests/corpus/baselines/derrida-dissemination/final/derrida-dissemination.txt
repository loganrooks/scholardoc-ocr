TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION
Since 1972, Derrida's work h continued to proliferate and diversify. Glas (a giant montage of textual gra§s and hardworking wordplays in which Hegel and Genet are shɭ=ed into each other from juxta*sed columns of print) ap(ared in 1974, followed, among humerous articles and short works, by a collection of critical essays on ¸inting, La Ìite ø Ôinture (1978), and, in 1980, by La Carte Ptale: A Sదate a FMud et au-A/a, an intriguing collection of essays that treat the psychoanalytical writings of Freud and Jacques ðcan, preceded by a pseudo-3ctional, pseudo-autobiographical epistola0 preface that hinges on a *stcard de picting Plato dictating 7hind die back of a writing SEKtes.
I. A Critique of Western Metaphysics
Best known in this count0 for having forged the term "d[onstXction," Jacques Derrida follows Niet§che and Heidegger in elaborating a critique of "Western metaphysics," by which he means not only the Western philosophical tradition but "eve0day" thought and lang~ge well. Western thought, says Derrida, h always 7en stXctured in terms of dichotomies or *larities: gÕ vs. evil, being vs. nothingness, presence vs. absence, tXth vs. error, identity vs. diRerence, mind vs. matter, mŌ vs. woman, soul vs. ĭy, life vs. death, nature vs. cʅIOure,-speech v;. writing. mî *lar op*sites do not, however, stand inde(ndent and eq~l entities. The second term in each pair is considered the negative, corXpt, undesiKble version of the 3rst, a fall away from it. Hence, absence is the lack of presence, evil is the fall from gÕ, error is a distortion of tXth, etc. In other words, the two terms are not simply opºed in their meanings, but are arranged in a hieKrchical order which gives the 3½t term jaɪ, in both the tem*ral and the qualitative sense of the word. In generĩ, what these hierarchical opºitions do is to privilege unity, identity, immediacy, and tem*ral and spatial·øtn4J over distance, diRerence, dissimɮation, and deferment. In its sArch for the answer to the question of Being, Western philosophy aÛ ind¡d always determined Being ·øŝ.
Derrida's critique of Western metaphysics fEus on its privileging of the s*ken word over the written word. The s*ken word is given a higher value because the s(aker and listener are both pr\ent to the utterance simultaneoÇly. There is no tem*ral or spatial distance between speaker, s(ech, and listener, since the sxaker hears himself s(ak at the same moment the listener d}s. This immediacy seems to guarantee the notion that in the s*ken word we know what we mean, mean what we say, Ày what we mean, and know what we have said. Whether or not (rfect

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION
Ķ understanding always Ecurs in fact, this image of perfectly self-present mvning is, according to Derrida, the underlying ideal of Western culture. Derrida aÛ termed this belief in the self-prùntation of mvning "Logo centrism," from the Greek word LogÎ (meaning s(ech, logic, re on, the Word of I). Writing, on the other hand, is considered by the logEentric system to be only a MuĶenʶtion of s(ech, a seconda0 substitute designed for uD only when s(aking is impossible. Writing is thus a second-rate activity that tries to overcome distance by making uD of it: the writer puts his thought on pa(r, distancing it from himself, transforming it into something that can 7 read by someone £r away, even a§er the writer's death. This inclusion of dvth, distance, and dilerence is thought to 7 a corXption of the self-presence of meaning, to o(n meaning up to all forms of adulteration which immediacy would have prevented.
In the cou} of his critique, Derrida d}s not simply reveØe this value system and say that writing is better than s(ech. Rather, he attempts to show that the very ºsibility of opºing the two terms on the basis of presence vs. absence or immediacy vs. representation is an illÇion, since s(ech is alϦdy stXctured by dilerence and distance much writing is. The very £ct that a word is divided into a phonic signਁ and a mental signਕ, and that, Saussure *inted out, language is a system of diler ences rather than a collection of inde(ndently meaningwl units, indicates that language such is alrvdy constituted by the ve0 distances and dilerences it seeks to overcome. To mvn, in other words, is automatically not to be. r sn there is meaning, there is dilerence. Derrida's word for this lag inherent in any signi¤ing act is dԘfȄance, from the French verb d৹fਠ, which means both "to diler" and "to defer." What Derrida attempts to demonstKte is that this Ɂ॓Ȅance inhabits the ve0 core of what aphØ to be immediate and present. Even in the s¢mingly nonlinguistic are of the stXctures of consciousness and the unconscious, Derrida analyzes the underlying necessity that induces Freud to compare the psychic ap´ratus to a stXcture of scriptural dਃ࣡ance, a "mystic writing-´d. "1 The illusion of the self-presence of mvning or of consciousness is thus pr^uced by the repression of the dilerential structures from which they spring.
Derrida's project in his early writings is to elaborate a science of writing called gram>toloe: a science that would study the e;ects of this dԘfȄance which Western metaphysics h systematically reprʆsed in its search for I. ¡e '"F9ud and tÁ {ene of Writing,"' in Writing and Di8+M, tĜns.

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION lf-present Truth. But, Derrida himself admits, the ve notion of a (xectly adequate I·en(e or -loe belongs to the logEentric discourse which the science of writing would t, precily, to put in questioí. Derrida thus 3nds himself in the uncomfortable §ition of attempting to account for an error by means of tls derived from that very error. For it is not *ssible to show that the belief in truth is an error without implicitly 7lieving in the notion of TXth. By the same token, to show that the bina op¹sitions of metaphysics are illusions is aׁo, and (rhaps most im¹rtantly, to show that such illusions cannot simply in turn S oppoi0 without re(ating the very same illusion. The t k of undoing the histo of logEentrism in order to disinter diffȄan(e would thus ap(ar to be a doubly im¹ssible one: on the one hand, it c° only be conducted by mAns of notio¥ of revelation, representation, and recti3cation, which are ti logEentric notions ¸r excellence, and, on the other hand, it can only dig up something that is really nothingċa diRerence, a gap, an inte¾al, a t×ce. How, then, can such a t k be undertaken?
II. Supplementa Reading
Any attempt to dintangle the weave of d৺fȄana from the logEentric blanket can obviously not long remain on the level of abststion °d generality of the preceding remarks. Derrida's writing, indeed, is always explicitly inscribed in the margins of some preexisting text. Derrida is, 3rst and foremost, a ª, a rAder who constantly reÐects on and tºnsforms the very natɯe of the act of reading. It would therefore (rhaps be helpwl to eÊine some of the s(ci3c reading strategies he h worked out. I begin with a chapter from Of Gram>toloe entitled "That ĵngerous Supple ment," in which Derrida elaboqtes not only a particularly striking reading of RoUseau's Co૯ioŁ but also a conci reÐection on his own meth eology.
Derrida's starting *int is the rhetoric of RousÙu's discussions of writing, on the one hand, and m turbation, on the other. Both activities are called Iupp/Ʌii to natural intercour, in the senɠ both of conversa tion and of copulation. What Derrida 3nds in Rousseau's account is a curious biwrcation within the values of writing and m turbation with res(ct to the desire for presence. ľt us take writing 3rst. On the one hand, Rousseau condemns writing úr being only a representation of direct s(ech and therefore l\s desi×ble because less immediate. RoussAu, in this context, privileges s([h the more dipct eʇpression of the self. But on the other hand, in the act~l

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION
XI ex%rience of living s%ech, RousĆu Gnds that he exprses him)lf much less successlly in %āon than he dó in his writing. Becaď of his shyns, he tends to blurt out things that repþnt him $ the opöite of what he thinks he is:
I would love s]iety like others, if I were not sure of showing myself not only at a disadvantage, but $ completely di[erent from what I J. The ^rt that I have taken of kiting aϓ hi΍ng myse÷ is precisely the one that suits me. lfl were present, one would never know what I w$ wonh. 1
It is thJ absence that $sures the presentation of tTth, and presence that entails its distonion. Ìrrida's sׄmation of this contradicto< stance is $ follows:
Straining toward the reconstTction of presence, (RoJs5u] valorizes and disqualiGes writing at the me time.... Roהוu condemns writing $ destTction of presence and $ disãe of s%ech. He rehabili tates it to the extent that it promises the r5ppropriation of that of which s%ech allowed itself to be disøùú. But by what, if not already a writing older than s%ech and alr5dy installed in that place? (Pp. 14 1ٵ2)
In other words, the loss of presence   always alr5dy begun. S%ech itself springs out of an alienation or di[erance that h$ the ve< stTctu_ of writing.
It would seem, though, that it is precisely through this $sumption of the necessity of absence that RoJseau ultimately succeeds in r5ppropriat ing the lost presence. In sacriGcing himself, he recu%rates him)lf. This notion that self-sacriGce is the rd to self-redemption is a cl$sical stTcture in Western metaphysics. Yet it can be shown that this project of r5ppro priation is inherently )lf-subvening becaJe its ve< starting Aint is not presence it)lf but the ϶iM for presence, that is, the ݤ,k of presence. It is not Assible to desire that with which one coincides. Õe staning Aint is thus not a ୲int but a di[erance:
Without the Assibility of di[erance, the desire of presence $ such would not Gnd its breathing-s^ce. That m5ns by the same token that 2. Quoted in Of Graņto/oħ (t|ns.

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION this desire carries in itself the destiny of its nonsatisfaction. Differance preuces what it forbids, making ¹ssible the ve¿ thing that it makes im§sible. (P. 143)
The same paradoxical account of the desire for prtence ±curs in Rous sAu's discussions of sexuality. On the one hand, m turbation is con demned a means of "cheating Nature" and substituting a mere image (absence) for the presence of a Dxual parner. On the other hand:.
This vice, which shame and timidity find so convenient, hĮ a particu lar attraction for lively imaginations. It allows them to dis¹se, so to sxak, of the whole female sex at their will, and to make any bAuty who tempts them serve their ple ure without the need of 3rst obtain ing her consent. (P. 151 [ 109))
It is thus the woman's absence that gives immediacy to her imaginary *ssession, while to deal with the woman's presence would inevitably be to confront dile»ce. M turbation is both a symbolic form of ideal union, since in it the subject and object  truly one, and a radical alienation of the Dlf from any contact with an other. The union that would (rf[tly wl3ll desire would also (rf[tly exclude the s¸ce of its ve0 §sibiliÅ. Just s¶ech w shown to be stXctured by the same dileKnce writing, so, t, the desire to *sDss a "real" woman is grounded in distance, both because the prohibition of incest requires that one's love object always be a substitute for the original obj[t, and because of the wndamental stXcture of desire itDlf. RoussAu's autobiography ole½ U a particularly striking e¡mple of the tDntial role of dile»ce in desire. Faced with the §sibility of a qu i-incttuoU relation with the woman he called "Mama"-incest being the ve0 meel of the elimination of diler ancŧ-RoussAu 3nds that his desire manifests itself in inverse pro*rtion to Mama's physical proximity: "I only felt the wll strength of my attach ment to her when she w out of my sight" (p. 152 [ 107)). Not only d}s the enjoyment of presence apxar to Rousseau to be im*ssible; it also could be £tal: "Ifl had ever in my life t ted the delights of love even once in their plenitude," he writes, "I do not imagine that my frail existence would have been suf3cient for them. I would have been dead in the act" (p. 155). Presence, then, is an ambiguous, even dangeroU, idAl. Dir[t sxech is Dlf-violation; perfect heter}roticism is dAth. Recourse to writing and aut}roticism is necessa0 to r[apture a prùnce whe lack h 'not been preceded by any wllness. Yet these two com(nÀto¿ activities are them selves condemned unnecessa0, even dangerous, supplements.

TRANSLATOR's INTRODUCTION
XIII
In French, the word supplࣃnt aÛ two mAnings: it mAns both "an addition" and "a substitute." RousÙu uses this word to d\cribe both writing and m turbation. Thus, writing and m turbation may aɀ to something that is already prùnt, in which c e they  su୤uoD, AND/oR they may Mplace tmething that is not preDnt, in which cő they are nĶ¥saé. Su(rÐuous and n[\sa0, dangerous and redemptive, the supple ment moves through RoussAu's text according to a ve0 strange logic. What Derrida's reading of RouɡAu sketch\ out is indeed nothing less than a revolution in the ve0 logic of mAning. The logic of the supplement wrenches apart the neatness of the metaphysical bina0 op*sitions. I¥tead of " A is op*sed to B" we have "B is both added to A and replaces A." A and B are no longer op*sed, nor are they equivalent. Indeed, they are no longer 7en equivalent to themselves. They are their own diRerance from them selves. "Writing," for example, no longer mAns simply "words on a page," but rather any diRerential tKce structure, a stXcture that also inhabits s(ech. "Writing" and "sxech" can thereúre no longer be simply op§ed, but neither have they 7come identical. Rather, the ve0 notion of their "identities" is put in question.
In addition to this supplementa0 logic in the text's signԛ, the insepar ability of the two senDs of the Ȟd "supplement" renders any a¤rmation that contains it problematic. While RoUDau's explicit intentions are to k¡p the two Dnses rigorously distinct-to know when he mAns "substi tute" and when he means "addition"-the shadow preDnce of the other mAning is always there to undermine the distinction. On the level both of the signi3ed and of the signi3er, therefore, it is not *ssible to pin down the dividing lines between excess and lack, com(nsation and cor½ption. The doubleness of the word supplΘct carries the text's signi¤ing *ssibilities hond what could re onably 7 attributed to RoussAu's conɟious inten tio¥. Derrida's reading shows how RousÙu's text wnctions agait its own explicit (metaphysical) sertions, not jUt by crAting ambiguity, but by inscribing a systòtic "other message" behind or through what is being said.
III. Deconstction
Let us now examine more closely the strategies and sumptions involved in this ty( of critical reading. It is clear that Derrida is not seeking the "m.ning" of Rousseau's text in any traditional sense. He neither adds the text up into a 3nal set of themes or ňŉrmations nor lks for the realiÅ of RousÙu's life outside the text. Indeed, says Derrida, there is no outside of the text:.

TRANSLATOR's INTRODUCTION
There is nothing outsiA of the t×t [i/ n'y a ás A hors-t×te]. And that is neither because JAn-Jacques' life, or the existence of Mŋa or Therese tঝel֫, is not of prime interest to us, nor ŗause we have access to their so-called "real" existence only in the text and we have neither any means of altering this, nor any right to neglect this limitation. All re ons of this ty( would already be su¤cient, to be sure, but there are more radical re ons. What we have tried to show by following thį guiding line of the "dangerous supplement," is that in what one calls the ¦l life of these existences "of Ðesh and bone," beyond and 7hind what one believes can be circumscribed Rousseau's text, there h never been anything but writing; there have never 7en anything but supplements, substitutive signi3cations which could only come forth in a chain of diRerential references, the "real" su(¾ening, and being added only while taking on mAning from a tKce and from an invEa tion of the supplement, etc. Ęnd thU to in3nity, for we have read, in the text, that the absolute present, Nature, that which words like "real mother" name, have always already eÁa(d, have never existed; that what o(ns meaning and language is writing the disapxarance of natural presence. (Pp. 15>59; emph is in original)
Far from being a simple warning againSt the biographical or referential fallacy, i/ n'y a ̫ A hors-t×te is a statement derived from Roגדu's autobiogKphy itself. For what Rousseau's text tells us is that our ve relation to "reality" already functions like a text. Rousseau's account of his life is not only itself a text, but it is a text that s(aks only aut the textuality of life. Rousseau"s life d¦ not ΃աe a text through his writing: it always already wÚ one. Nothing, indeed, can be said to £ not a text. Derrida's reading of Rousseau's autobiography thus pro*ses a "decon struction" of its logocentric claims and metaphysical sumptions. Decon struction is not a form of textual vandalism designed to prove that meaning is im§sible. In fact, the word "de-constXction" is closely related not to the word "destXction" but to the word "analysis," which etymologically means "to undo"-a virtual synonym for "to de-construct." The decon stɑction of a text d}s not prEeed by random doubt or generalized skepticism, but by the careful te ing out of warring forces of signi3cation within the text itse੥ If anything is destroyed in a deconstructive reading, it is not meaning bui: the claim to unequivEal domination of one mee of signi?ing over another. This, of couqe, implies that a text signi35 in more than one way, and to varying degret of explicitness. Sometimes the discrepancy is pr_uced, as here, by a double-edged word, which se¾es ) a hinge that both articulates and breaks open the explicit statement being. = 1.. ur ae. a. PIE --.. a

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION p made. Sometimes it is engendered when the ¦gurative level of a statement is ar eds with the literal level. And sometimes it Ecurs when the so-called starting *int of an argument is based on presupºitions that render its conclusions problematic or circular. ĥrrida de¦nes his reading strategy  follows:
The reading must always aim at a certain relationship, un(rceived by the writer, Ĭtween what he commands and what he dÔs not com mand of the patterns of the language that he uses. This relationship is not a cenain quantitative distribution of shadow and light, of weak ness or of force, but a signi¤ing structure that the critical reading should ୿u(e. (p. 158; emphis in original)
In other words, the deconstructive reading dÔs not *int out the Ñaws or weakntDs or stupidities of an author, but the n«¥sity with which what he Ó see is systematically related to what he d¦ not see.
It can thus be seen that deconstruction is a form of what aÛ long Ĭen called a mtique. A critique of any theoretical system is not an examination of its Ñaws or im(rfections. It is not a set of criticisms designed to make the system better. It is an analysis that f\uses on the grounds of that system's *ssibility. ńe qi_tique rAds backwards from what seems natur!, oʈ vious, self-evident, or universal, in order to show that these things have their histo0, their reons úr being the way they are, their eRects on what follows from them, and that the starting *int is not a (natural) given but a (cultural) construct, usually blind to itself. For example, Copernicus can be said to have written a critique of the Ptolemeic conception of the universe. But the idea that the earth g¦ around the sun is not an imஅt of the idea that the sun gÔs around the earth. It is a shi> in (rs(ctive which lite×lly makes the ground move. It is a deconstruction of the validity of the commonsense perception of the obvious. In the same way, Maɔ's critique of *litical economy is not an improvement in it but a demonstration that the theo0 which starts with the commeity Ő the basic unit of [onomy is blind to what pzšc6 the commeity-namely, labor. Eve0 theo0 scans somewhere; every critique ex*ses what that starting *int conceals, and thereby displaces all the ideas that follow from it. The critique d¦ not k ""what dÔs this statement mࢌn?" but "where is it being made from? What does it presuppose? Are its presup*sitions compatible with, inde(ndent of, and anterior to the statement that seems to follow from them, or do they already follow from it, cont×dict it, or stand in a relation of mutual degndence such that neither can exist without *siting that the other is prior to it?"

TRANSLATOR's INTRODUCTION
In its elaboration of a critique of the metaphysical forces that structure and smother diRerance in eve0 text, a d[onstructive reading thU Œsumes: 1. That the rhetoric of an sertion is not necesɝrily compatible with its explicit meaning. 2. That this incompatibility can be read systematic and signi3cant ĵ such. 3. That an inqui0 that attempts to study an object by means of that ve0 object is o(n to certain analyzable aberrations (this (rtai¥ to virtually all im*rtant investigations: the self analyzing itDlf, man studying man, thought thinking about thought, lang~ge s(aking about lang~ge, etc.). 4. That certain levels of any rigoroU text will engender a systematic double mark of the insistent but invisible contradiction or diRerance (the repr\sion of) which is n[\ɞ0 for and in the text's ve0 elaboration. But if the traditional logic of meaning an unequivEal structure of m teɕ is Western metaphysics, the d[onstruction of metaphysics cannot simply combat logEentric meaning by op*sing some other meaning to it. DiRerance is not a "concept" or "idea" that is "truer" than preDnce. It can only be a prEess of textual Ͽk, a strategy of kiting.
IV. Deda's Styles
Early in "The Double Łssion," in the courD of a discussion of the *ssible Hegelian or Platonic overtones of the word "Idea" in Mallarme's writing, we read the following warning:
But a reading here should no longer be carried out a simple table of concepts or words, a static or statistical trt of punct~tion. One mUt reconstitute a chain in motion, the eR[ts of a network and the play of a syntŔ. (P. 194)
This warning applies equally well to Derrida's own writing, in which it is all t tempting to fEU on certain "key" terms and to compile them into a static lexicon: suppÜ, Ɂ×Ȅanĵ, p/Cöon, ঻Ճn, etc. Becaɰ Der rida's text is constructed a moving chain or network, it co¥tantly frustrates the desire to "get to the *int" (e the remarks on the dancer's "*ints"in "The Double Session"). In accordance with its deconstruction of summa0 meaning, Derrida's writing mimes the mȮt of desire ratheÐ than its Òl3llment, reÒsing to stop and totalize itself, or doing ռ only by feint. Some of the m[hanisms of this signi¤ing fɒtration include: I. Syntax. Derrida's grammar is often "uns(akable"-i.e., it conforms ro the laws of writing but not necessarily to the cadences of s(ech. Ambiguity is rampant. ParentheDs go on for pages. A sentence Ŗginning

It is though the borderlines of the text had to be made to Ȁ the mark of the silencȏd the ¸thosČthat lie beyond its fringes, if the text had 3rst and l t to more actively diÁonn[t itself from the log toward which it still pires. 4. Multiple ϭতcÜ. The unit of coherence here is not necesÀrily the sntence, the word, the fgraph, or even the esÀy. DiRerent threads of DissiØtion rÆ woven together through the bindings of gºmmar (the Òture (rfect), "theme" (stones, coluns, folds, caves, beds, textil\, seeds, etc. ), lette½ ($, d, t), anagtmatical plays (grŊ/graph, semeX semantics, /ñ/ǳȣ), etc. 5. NonbiØé logic. In its deconstXction of the either/or logic of noncon tradiction that underli\ Western metaphysics, ĥrrida's writing attempts to elaborate an "other" logic. As he puts it in PositioŁ:
It h 7en necessa0 to analyze, to st to work, within the text of the histo0 of philosophy, well within the so-cĩled litera0 text... certain marks... that ½ aØloe...

V. Translation
To translate an author so exc½ciatingly aware of the minut\t linguistic diRerance is an exercise in violent approximation. On the one hand, one must try to 3nd an English equivalent not only for what Derrida says but also for the way in which his text dìe̯ from its own statements and from st°dard French usage. But on the other hand, theD micr³tructural diRerances cannot 7 privileged at the ex(nD of the text's *wer to intंe in the histo0 of philosophy and criticism. Nonetheless, since Derrida's m³t striking intervention is pr0isely his way of reworking writing, I have generally tried to align my English with Derrida's dissemi native in3delity to French rather than reduce his French to the statement of a thought about dissemination. Hence, every wea*n availablũ-from ðtin to neologisms to American slang-h 7en mobilized to k¢p the jug gling-puns in the air. The normal English equivalent of n'a֬ir ric a ֬ir aÈ, for instance, is "to have nothing to do with." But since the literal meaning of the expression is "to have nothing to sÑ with," Derrida sometim\ uses it in the context of a discussion of "seeing." It w therefore necessa0 to resort to the coll`uial use of "a damn sight" (meaning "a bit") and to translate L'৭ituM... n' a ric a y voir. Eψea plutot a (s'l a¦uglÛ "Writing... h n't a damn sight to do with it. It h rather a blindness to do with it" (p. 135). Or again mࢣk ár s¥ ஃ signÜ liteKlly means "mesmerized by its own signs," but the word લDk, referring it d¦ to the Medusa, also impli\ "being turned to stone." Hence, the (doubtless related) contem*ra0 senD of "getting stoned" h 7en called u*n in rendering ળk árs¥ ஄ sign¥ "letting itself get stoned by its own signs" (p. 105). Or yet again, the expressionęay2aÈ means "to sEiate with," but<ay3 alone means "to blaze a trail." Hence un t¡te... a֨ lȃuel il faut frayŨ becomes "a text one must make tracks with" (p. 270). Syntax h been the greatest stubling blEk. The "in £ct" included in "nothing w any more, in fact, rAl" (p. 43), for example, h its sole wnction the crAtion of ambiguity in the "any more" (which becomes both q~ntitative and tem*ral). In Mallarme's Mimique, the comma after qui le lit se¾es to problematize the antecedent of qui. Hence,le role, qui le lit, tout A suite compMnd can mean either "the role, wh}ver reads it instantly understands" or "the role, which reads him, instantly includes." I have attempted to pnder the ambiguity by translating this "the role, the one that reads, wilf instantly comprehend."

o. TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

Some jUti3cation may be in order regarding my rendering of the tide of the o(ning ·essay of the Įok ("Hors livre, prefaces") "Outwork, Hors d'uuvre, Extratext, Foreplay, Bkend, Facing, Pre£cing" (e p. 1). Since no (rfect equivalent presented itlf, and since that essay, in its complex way of questioning the relations between "prefaces" and "ooň," is µicularly di¥cult to follow, it seemed to me uful to conjugate out some of the Kmi3cations of this "'tide" and to o(n DissiØtion with a kind of miniaturized veØion of its stKnge text~l logic.
Many of the word plays, al, have been lost. While ॐs (thrvds) is ty*graphically identical to w (sons), "threads" d² not sound anything like "sons" (the clostt I could get w "3lial 3laments" (p. 84)). Yet it h 7en interesting to discover that, while many of these word plays were disap¶aring, others, just (ɓive, tCough a str°ge son of sym¸ thetic ink, kept apiing. One might almost believe, for instance, that, with its recurring emph is on wvving and seeding, DissiØtiå1 had 7en waiting all along for the English homonymy between "sow" and "w" to suyce.
There is one p sage in the Įok tBt I have been sorely tempted not to tackle: it is a letter written by Philip( Sollers to Derrida between the ɩo halves of the "Double Session." The letter plays on Mallarme's Mimਝue, whose text it tKnsforms by twisting its graphic and phonic signi3ers in such a way to reveal surprising sEiations and unexpected inte~ctions with the text of"The Double Session" into which it is insened. To tra¥late łllers' letter, one must 3nd an equivalent not for its words but for its Mlation to Mallarme's Mimique. Hence, the translation is a fourfold p|ess of transformation: the English version of the letter must relate to the English veØion of Mimique the French version of the letter relates to the French version of Mimique, but at the saF tiF the traYformations wrought by the English version of the letter must preuce results aØlogous to those preuced in the French. "Meaning" here thus wnctions not a prima f±us but a (OŁtraint on the translation of text~l dilerance. This fourfold system of relations is, indeed, paradigmatic of the di¥cul tit involved in translating the whole of DissiØtion. Just Sollers' letter repreuces and ʉeworks Mallarme's Mimique, so Derrida's writing both employs and subvens the standard usage of French. In both c es, it is the transformational work Kther than the "ide " that must be rendered in translation. In addition, the word "translate" 3gures prominently ִthin Mallarme's text, just the problematics of translation (¾ade all of Derrida's writings. I therefore here oRer the following parallel texts in lieu of a theo of translation (see pp. £- iii).

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION
VI. Dissemination
In DissiØtion, then, Jacques Derrida undenakes a 7nely (dis)asiculated meditation on the problematics of presentation and representation in the histoE of Western philosophy and literature. The "pre-texts" for this inquiry are Plato's PĎä (in "Plato's Pharmacy"), Mallarme's Mimique (in "The Double?ssion"), Philip2 Sollec' NombÏ (in "Dissemination"), and an encyclo2dic ar8y of prefaces and pseudonyms (in "Outwork"). These, of course, Oe only the m¹t prominent 7gures in a text that combs the histoE of reading ( well ( that of writing for the threads with which to weave its signiVing warp.
In the following remarks, I shall attempt to offer not a summary of the major them and theses of DissiØtion but rather a kind of roadmap that will detail some of its prominent routes and detours.
A. P`to's Pha૳, $ ti DଁoϨng of PhilosopÍ "Plato's Pharmacy" takes o from the PহOä, a Platonic dialogue in which the function and value of writing Oe explicitly discussed. Érates is taking a stroll with the handsome young Phaed¡s, who holds, hidden under his cloak, the text of a s2ech by the sophist Lysi( in which it is demonst8ted that one should yield rather to a nonlover than to a lover. In the course of the dialogue, SU8tes listens to Phaedɏ read Lysi(' sȺȻh and then utters two s2eches of his own. This exchange of discouces on love is followed by a discussion of speech, rhetoric, writing, seed sowing, and play, in the couce of which É8tes recounts the myth of Theuth, the inventor of writing.
SUrates' condemnation of writing and his ºnegyric to direct s2ech ( the pro2r vehicle for dialectics and Truth have for centuries %en taken almost exclusively at face value. "Platonism" can indeed 7 seen ( another name for the histoE of strongly stɈssed metaphysical binarity. What Jrrida dÒs in his reading of Plato is to unfold those dimensions of Plato's t×t that work against the grain of (Plato's own) Platonism. Although Jrrida dÒs not make his prUedures explicit, he can 7 sbn to intepene along the following routes: 1. Translation. It can 7 said that everything in Jrrida's discussion of the PhaOrus hinges on the tɅslation of a single word: the word p/քօkon, which in Greek can mean both "remedy" and "poison." In reġrring to writing ( aphaքօkon, Plato is thus not making a simple value judgment. Yet t8nslators, by chrsing to render the wol sometimes by "remedy" and sometimes by "poison," have consistently ॒iҲ what in Plato remains... aan *4 n... «..”-. - oe u... ^.. aa. - ^ -. -..”-.

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION sV undecidable, and thus inȂuenced the course of the entire history of"Platon ism." When one recalls the means of SUrates' death, one %gins to fe just how crucial the undecidability %twbn 6ison and remedy might %. But the notion of t8nslation at work here cannot % con7ned to the exactitude or inexactitude of the rendering of a single "word. " By fUusing on the translation of p/Ϫkon, Jrrida strikes at the heû of philosophy itself: We hope to display in the most striking manner the regulO, ordered 6lysemy that h(, through skewing, indetermination, or overdetermination, but without mistranslation, 2rmitted the render ing of the same wol by "remedy," "recipe," "6ison," "drug," "philter," etc. It will also % ɞen to what extent the malleable unity of this concept, or 8ther its rules and the st8nge logic that liȥ it with its signi7er, h( %en dispeced, m(ked, oblite8ted, and rendered almost unreadable not oȦy by the imp¡dence or empiricism of the translators, but 7rst and foremost by the redoubtable, irreducible dif7culty of tɆslation. It is a dif7culty inherent in its very principle, sitted less in the p(sage from one langge to another, from one philosophical langge to another, than already, ( we shall fe, in the tradition %ɐbn Greek nd Grbk; a violent dif7culty in the transĢr ence of a non-philosopheme into a philosopheme. With this problem of translation we will thus % dealing with nothing less than the problem of the veE ȳsage into philosophy (Pp. 71-72).
Plato's "original" text is thus itself alrfdy the battle7eld of n impossible prUess of t8nslation. 2. AØঁam>tica/ t¡tu̩. Jrived ȃom Saussure's discoveE of the anagrammatical dis2rsal of certain proper n\es in ìtin ȼtE, this expression dpignates the systematic insistence of the word p/ϪԺon and its relatives in Plato's text. Beginning with the p(sing mention of a mythical 7gure õed "Pharmacia," and continuing through the word "pharmakeus" (sorcerer, magician), Jrrida also notes the abscce of the word "pharmakos," which means "scapegoat." In this way, a signiȄing chain %longing neither entirely to Plato's text nor entirely to the Grbk language enables Jrrida to reflect on the very relation %tween individual discouce and language itself. 3. ʄt˺al assՙiation. By following all the senses of the word phaϪԺon, Derrida brings into play many other contexts in which the word is used by Plato, thus folding onto the problematics of writing such "other" domains ͝ medicine, painting, 6litics, Ġrming, law, sexuality, festivity, and family relations.

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION 4. Myth. In am(sing a detailed account of other Western myths of writing, Jrrida shows the overdetermination of certain structures in the sup6sedly "original" Platonic myth of Theuth. 5. Writing: litÛal and¿gurati౩. Paradoxically enough, Plato resorts to the notion of "writing in the soul" in order to n\e the otĞ of writing, the self-present Truth that s୒ech-not writing-is designed to convey. This return of writing precisely as w/t यuʱ throws the explicit op6sition %twbn spbch and writing³and %twbn literal and figurativēĔkew. 6. Family scenÜ. The insistence of a paternal and parricidal vcabulary lods Jrrida to reSect ´th on the relations %tween ºternity and lan gge and on the \biguities entailed by the fact that Plato, a son figure, is kiting, from out of the death of Érates, of Érates' condemnation ̟ writing as parricide.

In "The Double ìssion," Jrrida executes a kind of "p( de deɣ"-both a dance of duplicity and an er(ure of binarity-with the history of a certain interpretation of mimÜis. The cl(sical understanding of mimesis, derived in ºrt from Plato's ex\ples of the Bed and the Ýve (which Jrrida here calls the Antre), is fundamentDly ontological: it involves either the self presentation of a %ing-present or a relation of adequation %twbn an imitator and an imitated. Alongside the mimetic hierùchies of Plato, Jrrida h( placed a short text by Stephane Mallarme, Mimique, in which, according to Derrida's reading, what is imitated is not a referent or a reality but 8ther the very scheme of mimpis itself.
Simultaneously revealed and concealed %hind a v(t panoply of erudi tion, allusion, and wordplay, the following o2rations can % discerned in Jrrida's text: l. ShwtshÑting Plato's ˫. Into Plato's catalogue of variously made %ds, Jrrida inserts MallOme's shos account of a Pierrot miming the murder of his wife. Writ(h)ing u6n the conjugal sheets, the Mime plays both man and woman, ple(ure and doth, "in a hymen (out of which Sows Dre\), tainted with vice yet sacred, %twbn desire and ful7llment, ȶr2t8tion and rememb8nce: here anticipating, there recalling, in the future, in the p(t, unAr the false appTrance of a pÏct. " Through the syntactical \biguities of Mimique and the double moning of the word "hymen" (both "memb8ne" and, Ochaically, "marriage") Jrrida man ages to show that the mime's "o2ration" is a "2r2tl allusion" to himself on the 6int of alluding, in which the dierance %tween the imitator and the imitated is at once preseqed and erýd. The fact that the French word for %d, lit, can also mon "reads" is pivotal to this analysis, in which what Mallarme calls the "des28te practice" of reading is so deeply embedded. "Reading," indeed, is the l(t word of Mimi que. 2. SÔlunking in the Antre. Plato's second mimetic paradigm, the cave, Ȁnds itself translated, through the homonymy %tween ANTRE ("cave") and ENTRE ("%tween"), into various 7gures of 2netration and Oticulation. The most im6rtant of these is the "hymen," which, in signiVing both memb8ne and marriage, dignates ăth the virginal intactness of the... E waren 2. a ae a fe

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION distinction between the inside and the outside and the er(ing of that distinction through the commingling of self and other. Yet that alluringly foregrounded hymen-like the ɉst of the Jrridean "lexicon" of double edged wordɓ-is not indis2nsable:
What counts here is not the lexical richness, the semantic in7niteness of a word or concept, its depth or breadth, the Õdimentation that h( prluced inside it two cont8dictoE layec of signi7cation (continuity and discontinuity, inside and outside, identity and diqerence, etc. ). What counts here is the formal or syntactical praxis that comges and decom6ses it. We have indbd en making lieve that eveEthing could  traced to the word ȈȠ. But the irreplacfble chOacter of this signi7er, which everything seemed to gɇt it, w( laid out like a t8p.... It prluces its eqect first and foremost through the syntÌ, which dis6ses the "ct̩" in such a way that the sus2nse is due only to the placement and not to the content of the words..., It is the "tween," whether it ões Îsion or seºration, that thus cOries all the force of the o2ration. The hymen must  determined through the ct̩ and not the other way around.... What holds for "hymen" also holds, mutatis mutandis, for all other signs which, like phOmakon, supplement, diqeɄnce, and others, have a double, contradictoE, undecidable value that always derives from their syntÌ.... (pp. 220-2 1)
The pþÿge from Plato's antre to Mallarme's ct̩ is thus a ȴȵe from ontological semantics to undecidable syntÌ, from the play of light and shadow to the play of aniculation. 3. A Practice of spĨing. One of the 7ct things one notices about "The Double?ssion" is its provUative use of ty6graphic spacing. From the insertion of Mimique into an L-sha2d quotation from Plato to the quota tions in boxes, the p(sages from Un Coup ë Ð and Ą Liwe, the reprluc tion of Mallarme's handwriting, and the pages bottom-hfvy with frt notes, it is clfr that an eqos is ing made to call the reader's attention to the syntactical Înction of spacing in the act  reading. Through such supplementaE syntactical eqects, Jrrida duplicates and analyzes the ways in which MallOme's texts mime their own articulation, include their own blank spaces among their referents, and deploy themselves consistently with one textual fold tr many or tr few to  accounted for by a reading that would seek only the text's "message" or "meaning." By thus making explicit the role of the materiality of space within the act of understanding, MallarmĐ-and Jrridaµemonstrate the untenability of the logUentric

The histoE of MallOme criticism prior to Derrida can % grou2d into two gene8l moments: the Hegelian/ Platonic and the thematic/formalist. Jrrida's reading of Mimique enables him to work out a Qr-reaching critique of both moments. By skewing the form/content division, tracing the prolife8tion of plays of the signi7er, problematizing mimÜis, and putting the text's materiality to work ³ an excess of syntÌ over semantics, Jrrida puts in question the cl³sical mentalist, expressionist presup6sitioÑ and prcedures of the act of read ing itself.
C. DissiØtion, $ the Rʑounting of NumȽ
The ¹tensible subject of the es»y entitled "Dissemination" is a novel by Philip2 Sollec entitled Nums. The novel presents itself ³ a series of 1° p³sages num%red from l. to 4. 100, in which the num%r preceding the decimal 6int varies cyclically from l to 4 and the num%r following the decimal 6int gÒs numerically from S to 100 öter the 7ct group of l·. The text of the novel is explicitly heterogeneous and discontinuous: quota tions, parentheses, d³hes, cuts, figures, ød Chine characters are only the most visible manifestations of continual textual upheaval. On the jacket of Nums, Sollec presents the µok in the following terms:
How can the contradiction %tween discouce and (hi)stoE % lifted? unless it % through an exit out of the representational scene that maintains their op6sition? through a text whose orderly 2rmuta tions o2n not upon some s6ken ĝpression, but u6n the constantly active historical real?
Between the imperfect (sequences l/2/3) and the pmsent (sequence 4), which make up the sqre matrix that engenders the narrative and its reTection, is inscri%d the textl work that destroys any s2ctacu lar or imaginaE "truth. " That dest¡ction aects not only the hy6thetical "subject" of the story-his/her Ąy, sentences, and droms´but also the stoE itself, which is ovesurned and gradually immersed in texts of vOioû cultums. Writing thus %gins to function "outside," to burn in a self-constructing, self-eqacing, self-extending space according to the infiniɠ of its prluction. Such a theater, having neither stage nor house, where words have %come the actors and s2ctatoÔ of a new community of play, should also enable us to capture, across its inteÔecting surfaces, our own "time": the advent of

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION a dialogue %twbn West nd ßst, the question of the Ȳssage from alienated writing to a writing of the t8ce, through war, ɛx, and the mute, hidden work of transformation.
The novel primed here is not a printed novel. It refeÔ to the mythical milieu that is now w(hing over you, slipping into you, out of you, eveEwhere, forever, ( of tomorrow. It attempts to winnow out the movement of the depths, the depths that follow u6n µoks, the depths of the thought of m(ses, capable of shaking the veE founda tions of the old mentalist, expressionist world, whose end, ·ne takes the risk of reading, is at hand. (My translation)
Among other challenges is "Dissemination" 's gene8lized citatioblity, which is panicularly dif7cult to render in a traÑlation. In keeping with the pattern set by the essay in French, "Dissemination" apȹ without frtnotes. Quotations from NumbÛs are printed both in quotation mOks and in italics. Quotations from other works by Sollerɕ-T Park, Dra>, ågiŞ£e gene8lly identi7ed ( such in the Íy of the text. Other authors cited but not always identi7ed include such diverse 7gures ( Claude!, ìutreamont, Ro%rt Greer Cohn, Montaigne, Freud, Heidegger, SophUles, Aoaud, Hegel, and Mar. 4 MallOme is a coÑtant presence, but his textɗɘften mli7ed %fore inseoion¶o not always ap2ar in quota tion marks. To take just one example: in the oning pages, a discussion of the word "therefore" is preceded by a mli7ed quotation from Mallarme's lgitur ( ="therefore" in ìtin), which rĕds: "The tale is thereby addressed to the reader's Íy, which is put by things on stage, itself. " The original quotation reads: "Ce come s'adresse a I'lntelligence du Iecteur qui met les ch¹es en scene, elle-meme" ("This tale is addressed to the reader's InteRi gence, which puts things on stage, itself. "}. In changing "Intelligence" to "Íy," in making the reader into an objʑt of the activity of things, and in leaving the word "elle-meme" ["itself"] without a clear antecedent ("Íy" is m(culine), Derrida gives us a clue to the ty2 of t8nsformation entailed by "Dissemination. "
The multiplication of sources and the ditparnce of proper names is a literal enactment of Mallarme's insight into the "elUutionaɑ disapar4.

NumbΠ thus h( no proper, uni7ed, present origin; no one, outside the m(k or simulac¡m of some veE clever pseudonym, is entitled to the pro2sy rights or author's royalties... Authority and propesy still remain, though, ( pretentions of the attending discouce and ( dead suɋace eqects. (Even though, if two s2ci7c emblems Oe taken into account, while the proper n\e of the author is disapering in a constant equivUal motion of death and tfe-keeping or salvation, the n\e is only in fact in hiding: it conceals itself %hind the scrbn, behind "ti multipliÖtion of sÂÃ as bló of th~ Z Mign" ( 1. 2 5 ), or 7nds reÎge, without cėing to shine, a gem without air at the bottom of the µok, the cl(p, or the jewel-c(e, thanks' to "t/t ್ting t/t compris¥ a tangle of sࣳts, plumÜ, and the bl of the Tgle, which rࢲΠ to the teO f̣e of the suĪ p஫oİ stonࢀ stone that mİt S çchO ৸ one w~h¥ to go on úind the sun" (2. 34), %hind death. A pro2r n\e, then, ( it w( once penciled at the theater, "always rfdy to regain control. An intact jewel ӴϞau) %neath the diɚter." All you will have had to do, once this stone h( %en thrown out, is to go a bit further, %hind the citing of the ular stO [/'astM so`iM) (sun = death = mirror) in order to glimpse a 6iuned ring. Then an antidote and then the key. Which are all the same.) (pp. 32Ê29) ïe reader h( probably divined %hind the prolife8tion of solO imageE the pseudonym @llers. But he aÛ proEbly not seen in the "iQtact jewel" from MallOme a second n\e rfdy to regain control. Philip2 Sollec' "real" n\e is Joyaux.
Üth NumbÛs and "Dissemination" are attempts to ě 8ther than
Simply sÁte the thNretical upheavals prluced in the couɍe of a radical reevaluation of the nature and Înction of writing undesaken by Jrrida, íllers, Roland BOthes, Julia Kristeva and other contributors to the journal Tel Que/ in the late 1960s. Ideological and 6litical ( well ( literaE and critical, the Tel Que/ program attempted to push to their utmost limits the theoretical revolutions wrought by Mar, Freud, Nietzsche, Mallarme, levi-Strauss, Saussure, and Heidegger.
It is not surprising, therefore, to 7nd that "Dissemination" o28tes at the veù limits of intelligibility.

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION are fBgmented, fictionalized, put in quotation marks. NÝ linguistic and numerical logics are employed with Ûfling virtuity. Through the pun 1linking "Est" ("E7t"] and "Üt" ["is"], for instance, "Dissemination" inscri0s the West's orientation towjd Being 7 a relation to the Est it both desires and shuns. And through its insistence uAn sqĎes, crossrds, and other four-sided figures, "Dissemination" attempts to work a violent but im%rceptible displacement of the "triangular"-Dialectical, Trinitarian, Oedi^l-foundations of Western thought. This p7sage from three to four may perhaps 0 seen 7 a waing to those who, having underst the necessity for a deconstruction of metaphysical binari, might 0 tempted to view the num0r "three" 7 a gčrantee of li0Btion from the blindness of log]entrism.
D. OUÅORK, $ DԩsࣅØting PrӋacing
This bqk 0gins with a denial both of the Eok and of the 0ginning. The opening sentence, "This (the_fo_) will not have 0en a Eok," written in the ture perfect tense, marks itself 7 presentation ("this"), anticipation ("will"), negation ("not"), recapitulation ("have 0en"), and conclJion ("theref9re"). The juxtaAsition of the title (Hթ liಮ, lit. "outside the Eok") and the opening sennce is thus designed to map out the play of anticipato< retrospection and intealized exteriori involved in that metalinguistic moment of self-reflection traditionally known 7 the Pஞfʊe. Situated both inside and outside, both 0fo_ and aèer the "Eok" whose "Eok-ness" it kth promotes and tBnsgýses, the pre?ce h7 always inscriÝ itself in a stBnge warp of kth time and s^ce.
In writing a preface that deals with the simultaneous im÷sibility and necessity of prefacing, Derrida aÛ raised the prefato< double bind to a higher degree. The fact that his preface at once pre?ces and deconstructs the preface is perhaps an instance of the "systematic double mjk" with which it deals. While the reader expects to read a pre?ce to DԩsiØtion, what he finds is the word "dissemination" disseminated here and there within a preface on prefaces.
The Bqk, the Pre?ce, and the Encyclopedia M all structures of unifica tion and totaliētion. Dissemination, on the other hand, is what subverts all such recupeBtive gestures of m7te<. It is what foils the attempt to progress in an orderly way toward meaning or knowledge, what breaks the circuit of inntions or ex%ctations through some ungovernable excess or ls.
The challenge here is to "present" dissemination in a disseminative way. In a sense, the very success of such an attempt would 0 a sign of?ilure. To

This (therefore) will not have %en a µok.
Still less, dpite aperances, will it have %en a collection of tȒ "essays" whose itinerary it would be time, aUer the fact, to recognize; whose continuity and underlying laws could now % 6inted out; indeed, wh¹e overall concept or meaning could at l(t, with all the insistence required on such Uc(ions, % sqrely set fonh. I will not feign, according to the cle, either premeditation or improvisation. These texts are (ɜm bled otheøise; it is not my intention here to ȾĚt them.
The question (tir here, prĘisely, is that of presentation.
While the form of the "µok" is now going through a 2ril of general upheaval, and while that form now apȸs less natural, and its histoù less transparent, than ever, and while one cannot t\2r with it without disturbing eveEthing else, the brk form alone can no longer settlđ-here for examplK-the c(e of those writing prUesses which, in ȽíiĊlly questioning that form, must also dismantle it.
Hence the necessity, tlay, of working out at eveE turn, with redoubled eon, the question of the preseqation of n\es: ofpalþȨȡ. Why should an old name, for a determinate time, % retainę? Why should the eects of a new mfning, concept, or object % d\2d by memoù?
Posed in these terms, the question would already % caught up in a whole system of presup6sitions that ȇve now;< elucidated: for ex\ple, here, that of the signi7er's simple exteriority to "its" concept. One must therefore prUeed otheøise.
Let us %gin again. To take some eɥmples: why should "lite8ture" still designate that which alrfdy bɊks away from literaturŢţway from what hü always been conceived and signi7ed under that bmïðr that which, not merely escaping literature, implacably destroys it?

The preface would announce in rhe future tense ("this is what you are going to rUd") the conceptual content or signi1cance (here, that strfge st>tegy without 1nality, the debility or failure that organizes the telos or the ࢂchaton, which reinscris restricted economy within gene>l economy) of what will al̪y have en u@itten. And thus suf1ciently rࢍ to  gathered up in its mftic tenor and pro in advance. From the view+int of the fore-word, which recrUtes an intention-to-œy after the fact, the text exists # something written-a p#t-which, under the false appea>nce of a present, a hidden omnipotent author (in full m#teC  his pr<uct) is presenting to the reader # his future. Here is what I wrote, then rUd, and what I J writing that you are going to read. After which you will again  able to take ssession of this preface which in sum you have not yet gun to read, even though, once having read it, you will already have anticipated eveCthing that follows and thus you might just # well dispense with rUding the rest. The pre of the pre«ce makes the ¬ture present, represents it, d>ws it closer, breathes it in, and in going ahead of it puts it ahead. The ² reduces the future to the form of manifest presence.
This is an essential fd ludicrous ope>tion: not only cause writing # such does not consist in any of these tenses (prent, p#t, or ¬ture insofar # they are all m<i1ed presents); not only cause such an ope>tion would con1ne itself to the discursive egects of an intention-to-mUn, but cause, in inting out a single thematic nucleus or a single guiding thesis, it would cancel out the textual displacement that is at work "here. " (Here? Where? The question of the here and now is explicitly enacted in dissemina tion. ) Indeed, if such a thing were justi1able, we would have to ͠͡բ right now that one of the theseŐthere is more than on§-inscrid within dissemination is precisely the imssibility of reducing a text # such to its effects of meaning, content, thesis, or theme.

I I phy, on rhe other hand, this would give rise to the incongruity that along with the employment of such a methe its inability to g¼p the truth would also 7 demonstrated. (Phomoloe, p. 1)
This preface to a philosophical text rhU explains to us that, for a philophical text such, a preface is neither uÂful nor even possible. Ķs rhe preÏce rake place, then? Where would it rake place? How d}s this preface (the negative of philosophy) e¼e itself? In what mee d}s it come ro predicate? A negation of negation? A denial? Is it left high and dry by the philosophical prEess which acts for itself its own Åen֝tion, the very domestic retinue of irs own ex*sition (Da֑teRung)? ("The inner necessity that knowing should 7 science (' Wisщc WisщȂchâ sei) lies in irs nature, and only the systematic ex*sition (Darవe/lung) of philosophy itself pro vides it." Ibid. p. 3. ) Or is the prologue already cŏried away, 7yond itself, in rhe movement which is lEated in front of it Ŏd which seems to follow it only for having in txth pr1eded it? Isn't the preface th negated and internalized in the presentation of philosophy by itself, in the self preuction and self-determination of the concept?
Bur if something were to remain of the prolegomenon once inscri7d and inte¾oven, something that would nor allow itself to 7 sublared (஠ज} in rhe course of the philophical presentation, would that something neces sarily rake the form of that which faRs awì [ĳ tomøe}? And what aut such a Ïll? Couldn't it be v othe¾iÂ than the excrement of philo sophical essentialit¥-nor in order to sublate it back into the latter, of couqe, bur in order to l÷rn to rake it diRerently into account? Yes-if-Hegel writes beyond what he wants ro Ày, ÷ch page of the preface comes unglued from itself and is forthwith divided: Íbrid or bifacial. (Dissemination generalizes the theory and pKctice of the grâ without a ĭy p{(r, of the skӧ without a stKight line, of the bias without a front.) The preface that Hegel mDt write, in order ro denounce a preÏce that is both impossible and inescapable, mUt 7 signed two l]ations and two sorts of sco(. It 7longs th to the inside and to the ourside of the concept. Bur according to a prEess of mediation and dialecrical r÷ppropriation, the inside of s(culative philophy sublart its own ourside a moment of irs negativity. The preÏto0 moment is necessarily o(ned up by rhe critical gap 7rween the logical or scientific development of philosophy and irs empiricist or formalist lag. This, indeed, is a lesson of Hegel's to 7 maintained, if possible, 7yond Hege lianism: the essential complicity 7tween empiricism and formalism.

Kth formalism and empiricism; that culture must  fought, or rather "formed" ݑebilÙt) tter, cultivated more ceeTlly. The necessity of prefaces longs to the Biਗ਼. This struggle ap0ars ro  external ro philophy since it røes place 5ther in a didactic tting than within the self-presentation of a concept. Bur it is internal to philosophy ro the extent that, # the Preface also says, the exrerioriry of the negative (falseho,, evil, d_th) still longs to the praess of truth and must l_ve irs trace uRn it. ·ɳ Thus, after de4ning the intύ1 n«¥sity of the self-presentation of the concept, Hegel identi4es irs ¡t౴1 neİsity, the necÈsity that rakes rime into account # the existence (Dasein) of the concept. But it is at first only a question of the necessity of rime # a uniֶsal form of sensibility. One must then go on to recognize the gap tween this formal notion of rime, the gene5l matrix in which the concept is present, and the empirical or historical determination of rime, that of our tiĜ, for exple: Bur the ¡tύ1 necessity, so far # it is gïped in a gene5l way, setting #ide accidental matters of 0rson and motivation, is the se # the inner, or in other words it lies in the sha0 (G¥talt) in which rime sets forth the sequential existence of irs moments (wie die Zeit ' Dasein ih௄ MoFnte ಫsteht). To show that now is the propitious rime (an 1 Zeit) for philophy to  elevated to the status of a Dience would therefore  the only true justi4cation of any eto that h# this aim, for ro do so would demonst5te the nMeɑity of the aim, would indeed at the se rime  the accomplishing of it. (P. 3¦)
Bur since our tiĝ is nor exactly, nor simply propitious for such an elevation (Erhebung), since it is nor yet quire the right rime (an 1 Zeit), since the rime, at any rare, is not equal to itself, it is still necessag to prepare it and make it join up with itself by didactic means; and if one judges that the rime hĩ come, one must make others aware of it and intr,uce them to what is already tğ; tter yet: one must bring the ing-there back to the concept of which it is the tempo5l, historical presence (Dasein) or, in a circule f#hion, intr,uce the concept into irs own ing-there. A certain spacing tween concept and ing-there, tween concept and existence, between thought and rime, would rhus constitute the rather unquali4able l,ging of the preface. 14. "Against this view it must 3 maintained that tæth is not a minted coin that Ř 3 given and ĩketed r8dy-made." "O͊͋of this distinguishing, of cou̟, com° identity, and this ̋ultant identity is the tjth.

O UTWORK knowledge, that the two Koks o0n and recipraally envelop _ch other in a single volume. The prece to phenomenology is written from out of the end of logic. The self-prentation of the concept is the tʳe preface to all prefaces. Written prefaces are phenomena external to the concept, while the concept (the ing-abre#t-of-itself of absolute logos) is the true pre¦ace, the essential pM-dicate of all writings.
The form of this movement is dictated by the Hegelian concept of їlthʩ. Just # the lntrʩuaion (which follows the Prӌace) to the Phoόoloe of Spirit critiques that critique of knowledge which treats the latter # an itʳїlnt or a milieu, so also the lntvduaion to the Scice of Logic rejects the cl#sical concept of meth,: an initial set of de®nitions of les external to the o0rations, hollow preliminaries, an itinerag ÿsigned forehand to the actual route taken by knowledge. This is a critique adlogoʆ to the one Spinoô addressed to the Cartesian concept of meth,. If the path of science is itself science, then meth, is no longer a preliminag, external reÉection; it is the pr,uction and the structure of the whole of science # the latter exposes itself in logic. Hence, either the preface already longs to this exposition of the whole, engages it and is engaged in it, in which c#e the preface h# no s0ci®city and no textual place of its own, ing merely a püt of philosophical discouee; or else the prece esca0s this in some way, in which c#e it is nothing at all: a textual form of vacuity, a set of empty, dead signs which have faR, like the mathematical relation, outside the living concept. Then it is nothing but a mechanical, hollow MÔtition, without any internal link with the content it claims to announce. 17
But why is aR this explained precisely in pMfac¥? What is the statO of this third term which cannot siૂly, # a t¡t,  either inside philosophy or outside it, neither in the markings, nor in the maðhings, nor in the margins, of the ¤ok? This term that is never sublated by the dialectical meth, without leaving a remainder? Tȍt is neither a pure form, com pletely empty, since it announc¥ the path and the mantic pr,uction of the concept, nor a content, a moment of m_ning, since it remains external to the logos of which it inde®nitely feeds the critique, if only rhrough the 17. Sis formŋ reHtition without My link with the content, this purely ''rhetĜical" o̔ent, w1 something condemned by "gd rhetoric" well &fore Hegel. This veE condem{tion w1 alÍdy a toZs.

Cicero con5d- to Atticus that he h1 *t 1ide a whole coll:tion of p̂bles, thinking thÈ might come in handy some day.

O UTWORK gap between ratiaination and rationality, tween empirical history and conceptual history? If one sets our from rhe oppositions form/content, signi4er/signi4ed, sensible/intelligible, one cannot comprehend the writ ing of a preface. But in thus ròining, ds a preface ¡ist? Irs spacing (the preface to a rereading) diverges in (the) place of the řWȿ.
We have come to a remekable theshold [/iȪ}of the text: what can read of dissemination. Liȋ: mark, maðh, margin. Ómarcation. Mech ing order: quotation: "Nowhis quehn #so aLY) Bflf, e{l?tly, ͜ le quegS of le Ň̕. " (From the Prӌace to the Phenomoloe of Spirit) It might seem necīĬ at the outset to say more aKut the Ft঴ of this movement, i.e. of åience. But its concept is already to  found in what hM en said, and its pro0r ex^sition (eigtliche Darsteυung) longs to Âgic, or 5ther it is Âgic. For the meth, is nothing but the stcture set forth in its pure essentiality. We should realize, however, that the system of idÆ concerning philophical meth, is yet another set of lieȉ that longs to a bygone culture.

(P. 28)
The fMcination exerted by the formal m,el of mathematics would thus seem to have guided the clMsical philophers in their concept of meth,, in their methଇloe, in their dihourse on meth, or their rules for the direction of the mind. 11 This ill-ar5nged formalism would in sum consist in imposing u^n the presentation of truth a set of epig5phs that are either intole5ble ·to tth or that truth should pr,uce on its own; such a formalism blinds one to the path of truth and to the living historicity of 18. is rime rhe ʵth in question is nor only rhar of S|-.

OUTWORK 1 7 meth, # it exposes itself and engenders itself in the Logic. It is there, in the Logic, that the preface must and can disap0e.

What can  said here aKut this textual "event"? aKut this digÌph?
In no science is the need to gin with the thing itself (ɞn  Sache selbst), without preliminaf reSecrions (ohne ɟangehħ RĤionĥ), felt more strongly than in the science of logic. In every other science the subject matter and the scienti4c meth, are distinguished from each other; also the content dY nor make an absolute ginning but is de0ndent on other concepts and is connected on all sides with other material (StoȈ). These other sciences are, therefore, 0rmitted to s0ak of their ground and irs context and also of their meth,, only # premises taken for granted. (Logic, p. 43.)
The Intrȶéion to the Logic is subtitled "GeneÌl Concept ofȢogic. " The Ëeface must  distinguished from the intbuction. They do nor have the same function, nor even the sùe dignity, in Hegel's eyes, even though the problem they Ìise in their relation to the philosophical corpO of exRsition is analogoO. The Intr,uction (Einleitung)  a more systematic, lĩs historical, less circumstantial link with the logic of the ¤ok. It is unique; it deals with general and essential aðhitectonic problems; it presents the geneÌl concept in irs division and in its self-diterentiation. The Prefaces, on the other hand, ee multiplied from edition to edition and rake into account a more empirical historicity; they ȴy an ac#ional necessity that Hegel de4nes, of course, in a ɀface: the P`föe to the SĢond Edition of the SđPce of Logic. 19 And yet-this is why the problems are, # we said earlier, aȯlogoɜ-the Intɇduction, rk, should disap0ar, should (shall) have dis ap°ared, along with the Prefaces, in Âgic.

OUTWORK insofar as this absolutely uniಃ̱l philoɐphical science mOt provisionally, considering the prevailing lack of culture, intr,uce itself as a հrtɑu`r philosophical science. For the only legitimate place for an Intr,uction, within the system, is to o0n a paϰicular philosophical science, Esthetics or the Histoɢ ʪ PhilopÍ, for emple. The Intr,uction there acts ro link the determinate generality of the derivative, de0ndent discourses with rhe absolute, unconditional generality of logic. Hegel rhO by no m_ns contradicts himself when, in his ݪtuÏ on esthetics or on the history of philosophy, he Rsits the necessity of an intr,uction. '
The liminal space is thO o0ned up by an inadĨuarion jeen the form and the content of discoude or by an incommensurabiliə twģn the signi4er and the signi4ed. As skn as one tries ro reduce irs m#s [bl¨} ro a single suaace, the pòtaol always comes a formal instance. In all saieties, rhe chief of protaol is a functionaf of formalism. The inadequa rion tween form and content should er#e itself, however, in s0culative logic, which, in contr#t ro mathematics, is ar once the pr,uction and the pñsentation of irs own content: "Logic, on the cont5ry, cannot prÈuppose any of these forms of reÉection and laws of thinking, for these constitute » of its own content and have 4rst ro  established within rhe science.

Irs content is irs 4nal result: logic h# # irs object nothing other than scienri4ciry in general, the very concept of science, thought # such in#much # it conceives, knows, and thinks itself. If logic needs no lemma, ir is caOe, ginning with conceptual thought, it must also end with conceptual thought, and cause it ds nor at 4rst know all there is ro know aKut scienri4ciry, the concept of which will also  irs ultimate acquisition. And yet that ultimate acquisition mOt al°dy  irs premise; it mOt announce fòm the 4rst, abst5ctly, what it can only know at the end, in order that even in irs exordium it move already in the element of irs own content and need nor Krrow any formal rules from any other science. Whence the nMessity of setting in motion the following proRsition, which contradicts itself im઻iately if it is understo, according to a noncircular linearity:
What logic is cannot  stared forehand (౐raDsag), 5ther ds this knowledge of what it is first emerge # the 4nal outcome (ihr Letzt¥) and consummation (VoRdung) of the whole exRsition (ihM ganze AbÝndlung). Similely, it is essentially within the science that rhe subject matter of logic, namely, thought or more s0ci4cally concept±lizing thought (' SংÛ} Dkc) is considered; the con cept oflogic h# irs genÈis in the course (V)`uਮ of the exRsition and cannot therefore  premiɏd (v<aDg¥chickt). (Logic, p. 43)
ThO, Hegel mOt rehind the logical, scienti4c chþcter of an Intr,uc tion ro Âgic at the very moment that, within the act of proposing one (bur what is the textual o05tion of such a proposal?), he advances theM that Logic cannot  preceded by úy lemma or prolemma. He denies the logical character of his Intr,uction in conceding that it is bur a concession, that it ròi, like cl#sical philosophy, external ro its content, a mere formality designed ro remove itself on irs own initiative:
Consequently, what is premised in this Intr,uction is not intended, # it were, ro establish the concept of logic or to justiÊ irs meth, scienti4cally in advance, bur rather by the aid of some rÆoned (rԞsoni¤n}m) and historical explanations and reȆections to make more accessible to ordinary thinking the point of view from which this science is ro  considered. (Ibid., p. 43)
The constraint ro which the Intr,uction yields remains, of course, ÷cidental: one must correct the historical error into which philophers of borh former and latter days have allowed themselves ro stray. Entering into conȇict with them, Hegel marchĪ out into their territory, which is also

OUTWORK that of lemmarism, marhemarism, and formalism. Bur this error ing a form of negativity that cannot  avoided or eliminated (like the philo sophical "conversation" it prescribes), we ®nd it thought our, internalized, sublared by the movement of the concept, and in irs turn negated and absord # an integ5l part of the logical rexr. The necessity of this movement sounds pa5doxical or contradictog only if it is obse²ed from the exrerioriry of a formalist instance. This cont5diction is rather the very movement of s0culative dialectics in irs discursive progression. It con stcts the concept of the preface according ro the Hegelian values of negativity, sublation, presupposition, ground, result, circularity, ere., or according to the opRsition between certainty and tth. The signiÊing շe-ʎpitation, which pushes the preface ro the front, makes it seem like an empty form still deprived of what it wants to ³y; bur since it is ah_d of itself, it ¦nds itself predetermined, in irs rexr, by a semantic aΫ)-eʘ࢛. Bur such indeed is the essence of s0culative pr,uction: the signiÊing pre cipitation and the semantic after-etect are here hoैgࣔoD Äd continuous. Absolute knowledge is pruent at the zero point of the philosophical exposi tion. Irs teleology h# determined the preface # a Rsrface, the l#t chapter of the Phcomenoloe of Spirit # a foreword, the Logic # an Intr,uction to the Phenomcoloe of Spirit. This point of onroreleological fusion reduces Kth precipitation and after-etect to mere ap0arancÈ or to sublarable negariviries.
Hegel is rhO at once # close and # foreign # Rssible ro a "m,ern" conception of the text or of writing: nothing precedes textual gene5lity absolutely. There is no preface, no progr, or at le#t any Ëogram is already a program, a moment of the text, rNlaimed by the text from irs own exrerioriry. Bur Hegel brings this generaliôtion aKut by saturating the rexr with meaning, by teleogica/Jy equating it with irs concept±l ten<, by reducing all absolute dehiscence tween writing and wanting-to-say (̵u/oir-dire}, by er#ing a certain acurrence of the break jeen antiʎpa tion and r࢓apitulation: a shake of the head.
If the preface ap0ars inadmissible t,ay, it is on the cont5ry caOe no possible h_ding can any longer enable anticipation Äd recapitulation to meet and to merge with one another. To le one's head, no longer ro know where one's h_d is, such is 0rhaps the etect of dissemination. If it would  ludicrous t,ay to attempt a preface that really w# a preface, it is caOe we kn¯ semantic saturation to  impossible; the signiÊing precipitation intr,uces an excess facing [un ࡖÕrd} ("that part of the lining which extends yond the cloth, " according to Litrre) that cannot  m#tered; the semantic after-etect cannot  turned back into a teleological anticipation

OUTWOR K 2 1 and into rhe sSthing order of the future 3rfect; the gap,tween the empty "form," and the fullness of "meaning" is structuIlly irremediable, and any formalism, as well as any rhemaricism, will, impotent ro dominate rhar structure. They will miss it in their very attempt to master it. The generalization of the grammatical or the rexrual hinges on the diÐppear ance, or Ither the reinscriprion, of the semantic horizon, even when esŮcially when-it comprehends di[erence or plurality. In diverging from Űlysemy, comprising Yth more and less rhan the latter, dissemination interrupts the circulation that tInsforms into an origin what is actually an after-e[ect of meaning.
Bur the question of mning has barely,en o3ned and we have nor yet Œnished with Hegel. We knK, said we, a minute ago. Bur we know something here which is no longer anything, with a knowledge whose form can no longer, recognized under rhis old name. The treatment of paleonymy here is no longer a Iising or a regaining of consciousness. No"doubr Hegel, rS, allows for the insisrence21 of a cePain gap between rhe form and content. That is,,tween what he calls cePainty and what he calls truth. Isn't Ti Pin²lnoloॹ of Spirit precisely the history of such discrepancies? The recital of an in;nite prece? While criticizing formal ism, marhemarism, scienrism-which are always the errors of a philos opher-Hegel steers clear of rejecting rhe necessity for formal, mathemat ical, or scienti;c (in the restricted sense of the term) moments. He rakes care nor ro fall into the opposite errors: empiricism, intuitionism, prophet ism. The complicity tong these symmetrical failings chSses ro rake up residence in prefaces as irs favorite s<t. Bur it is still up ro a prece ro unmask that complicity, according ro the overŖow of a re-mXk (a preface on prefaces, a preface within a preface) of which dissemination must problemarize the formal |les and the abyssal mūement; there 9cu{ a completely di[erent reinscriprion of "dd space and the equally lifeless numerical Unit," altogether other and hence very similar, a reinscriprion rhar re ublu the Preface to the PhenoÞoloe of Spiit:

O UTWORK dead space and the equally lifeless numerical Unit. This methH, rS, in a lSser form, i.e. more blended with the Xbitrary and the accidental, may retain irs place, as in conve{ation (Konಁsation), or in a piece of historical instruction designed rather ro satis curiosiry (Neugi)}) than to prHuce knowledge (Erkenntnis), which is about what a preface (Vର଱}) amounts to.... Bur we have already <inted our that, once the necessity of the concept has banished the slipshH style of conve{ational discussion (}n losen Gang × rasoni)en}n Konv)salion) and along wirh it the 3dantry and pomposity of science, they are nor to be replaced by the non-methH (Unmeth՜) of presenti ment (~ Ahnens) and inspiration (Begeist)ung), or by the Xbitrariness of prophetic utterance, Yth of which despise nor only scienti;c <mposity, bur scientiOc pr9edure of all kinds. (Pp. 2Ü-29)
The sůulative dialectic muse overcome the op<srion between form and content, just as it must overcome all dualism or duplicity, without ceasing to, scientiOc. It mot scient৾ahy think our the opposition,tween science and irs other.
It is nor enough to arrive at triplicity in general, however, in order to attain the s3culative element of the concept. Formalism, rS, can accommHate triplicity: corrupt it, Ox it in a schò or a table of t࣯, reX it our of the life of the concept. The immediate target here is ½helling's philosophy of nature:
Of course, the triadic form (Tripliʎtat) mot nor be regarded as scientiOc when it is reduced to a lifeless schema (/eblos Sche>), to a mere shadow (zu einem eigmtlichen Schemm), and when scientiOc orga niÇtion is degraded into a table of terms (TaSl/e). Kant rediscovered this triadic form by instinct, bur in his work it was still lifeless and uncomprehended (unSgrԖfme); since then ir has, however, been raised ro irs absolute signiOcance, and with it the rrue (wahrhaΫe) form (Foʰ) in irs rrue content ,en presented, so that the concept of Science has emerged. This formalism of which we have already s<ken generally and whose style we wish to deµri, in more derail, imagines that it has comprehended and expressed the nature and life of a form (G¥talt) when it has endowed ir with some determination of rhe schema as a predicare. The predicare may ¢ subjectivity or objecriv iry, or, say, magnetism, elecrriciry, ere., contraction or expansion, east or west, and the like. Such predicares can be mulriplied to inOnity, since in this way each dererminarion or form can again, used as a form or moment in the case of ^ other, and each can

O UTWORK 23 gratefully 3rform rhe same se®ice for an ocher. In this sort of circle of recipr9ity one never learns what the thing itself is, nor whar rhe one or the or her is. In such a pr9edure, sometimes determinations of nnn are picked up from everyday intuition, and they are supposed, of cou{e, to ણn something di[erent from what they Ðy; sometimes what is in itnlf meaningful (Be}utenĤ), e.g. pure determinations of thought like Subject, Object, Substance, Cause, Universal, etc. these are used jusr as thoughtlessly and uncritically as we use them in everyday life, or as we use ideas like strength and weakness, expansion and contraction; the metaphysics is in the former case as unscientiOc as are our sensuous representations in the latter.
Instead of the inner life and self-movement (SelbstĂegung) of irs existence, this kind of simple determinateness of intuition-which means here sense-knowledgp-is p¤dicated in accordance with a superOcial analogy, and this external, empty application of the formu la (Foņe/) is called a "construction" (Konstruction). This formalism is just like any other. (Pp. 2Þ30)
The static classi;cation of dual op<sitions and of third terms, tbonom ical inscriptions, all varieties of anatomical thinking-i.e. the thinking of the preface, as we now know01onrenr themselves with la,ling inert, œnite prHucts. ½helling's philosophy of nature contains only a semblance of dialectical triplicity. From the outside, in a prefabricated "construc tion, " such philosophy applies simple oppositions, formulas prescri,d once and for all: somewhat as in a well-kept pharmacyƠơ or gr9ery Jrore, or 22.

OUTWORK even in a museum of natu5l history where one can 4nd collected, cl#sed, and exhibited all manner of dead limbs and cold Knes, skins dried like parchments, anatomical plates, Äd other tableaɝ and displays that pin down the living to death:
What results from this meth, of laling all... is a synoptic table like a skeleton with scraps of pa°r stuck all over it, or like the rows of closed and laled Kxes in a graer's stall (in ein) GडiపkrԞŀbuĤ).

To exhibit the realm of thought philosophically, that is, in its own immanent activity or, what is the se, in its neces³ry development, had therefore to be a fresh undertaking, one that had to  staced right from rhe ginning; bur rhis traditional material, rhe familie forms of thought, must be regarded # an extremely imRrtant source (V<lage), indeed # a necessary condition and # a presupposition ro gratefully acknowledged even though what ir otee is only here and there a meagre shred or a disordered heap of dead bones. (Logic, Preface to Second Edition, p. 3 1)
In contït ro this triplicity of death, rhe s°culative dialectic favors the living triplicity of the concept, which remains yond the gr#p of any eithmetic or of any numerology.

The writing of such a stog ălongs neither to the inside nor to the outside of the triangle; this is something the consequences of which we have hardly begun to mÆure.

No more anteriority or latedness of form, no more exteriority of content; tautology and heterology would coupled together in the s4culative pro+sition. The analytic pr6edure and the synthetic pr6edure would.mutşlly envelop each other. The concept is then enriched a priori by its own determination without going outside of itself, or through 4r4tual returns to itself, within the element of self presence. The egective determination of the "rPl" unites with "idPtional" reection in the immanent law of the sHe development.

This distinc tion alone would disrupt the r&b`nce tween the form of his own discouňe and the form of Hegel's presentation, a rªemblance that had led certain reviewers who "shriek out at 'Hegelian sophistics' " Otray. But one cannot undo this resemblance without t2nsformingÜalong with the oppositions form/matter or content (Form/Sto੔ and ideUity/materiality (lࠫelle/Mat)ieReೡ-the concepts of reection and anticipation, i.e. the relation tween the ginning and the development, twn intr<uc tion and pr6ess. This relation is not the same in discouŉ O it is in the real; it is not the same in the discourse of Ï«கh O it is in the pr&entation of the Ïult after the «ct.

Whilst the writer pictures what he takes to I my actual meth7 (wirk/iche Meth՜), in this striking and ($ far $ concerns my own appliLtion of it) geners way, what else is he picturing but the dialectic meth7?  course the meth7 of presentation (Da֑teɸung sĜise) must diKer in form ৷o૵{/) from that of inquiW (Forschung sĜਦe). The latter h$ to appropriate the material (Stoू in detail, to analyze its diKerent forms of development, to trace out their inner connection.

My dialectic meth7 is not only fundamentally (1 Gxnd/age dch) diKerent fȍm the Hegelian, but is its direct op`site (΍஝kt&
Gʒtei/). To Hegel, the life-prjAs of the human brain, i.e., the prjess of thinking (Denkոz¥z), which, under the name of "the Idea," he even transforms into an inde3ndent subject (in ein se/bststan dig& subjekt), is the demiurgos of the real world, and the real world is only the exteȌal, phenomenal form of "the Idea." With me, on the contrary, the ideal (iҾɸe) is nothing else than the material world (Mat)ie੓e) transóed (umg&etzte) by the human mind, and translated (ԟsetzte) into forms of thought. ll

From a Hegelian point of view, is the Aþöoras argumentation the Wi࠽rࢢ of an empirical realism that, in óiting the absolute exteriority of the real to the concept, of eKective determination to the prjess of prAentation, would nèesȘily end up $ a formalism, or even $ an idealist criticism indefinitely con>ned to its own preìce? etc.), we ap3ar to 0 limiting ourselves to "textual" indications, it is 0cause we have now arrived at the `int where the relation Itween the "text"-in the narrow, cl$sical sense of the term-and the 3 1.

This lining fringe, chis extra edge, chis de-limitation, invites a rereading of the form of r relation to Hegel's logic and to all chat can be subsumed therein. The breakthrough coward radical otherness (with respect to the philosophical concept¡of the concept) always takes, within philosopÍ, the f] of an a posteriority or an empiricismY But chis is an effect of the sÏular nacure of philÍophical re§eêcion, philosophy 0ing incapable of inscribing (comprehending) what is outside it otheaise than through the appropriating $similation of a negative image of it, and dissemination is written on the back-che lain ¢f that mirror.

The question is to >nd out what ic is chat, written under the m$k of empiri cism, turning s3culation uÐide down, also ð so઩hing else and rende a Hegelian sublation [Xlਨ) of the preface impracticable.

OUTWORK 35 a force of historical no-return, resistant to any circulh recomprehen sion within the annAic domesticity (Erin૫ng) of ågos, which would recover and prjlaim truth in the fullness of its s3ech. We are in an uneven chi$mus. In Hegel's re$on for disqualiïing the preface (its formal exteriority, its signiïing precipitation, its textuality freed from the authority of m]ning or of the concept, etc. ), how can we avoid recognizing the veW question of writing, in the sense that is Iing analyzed here? The preface then Icomes necessaW and structurally inter minable, it can no longer I deôriId in terms of a sÏulative dialectic: it is no longer merely an empty form, a vacant signi>cance, the pure empiric icy of the non-concept, but a completely other structure, a more `werîl one, capable of accounting for eKects of meaning, ex3rience, concept, and r]lity, reinscribing them without this o3ration's Iing the inclusion of any ideal "SgMif." Inversely, isn't the ty3 of preface that always in fact imposes itself on Hegel (that movement through which the concept already announces itself, precedA itself in its own telos, establishes the têt within the element of its meaning from the outset), isn't this what in our eyA t7ay makes those preces ap3ar archaic, academic, contraW to the necAsity of the text, written in an ouȞorn rhetoric susÏt in its reduction of the chain of writing to its thematic eKects or to the formality of its articulations? If dissemination is without a preface, this is not in order that some sort of inaugural pr7uction, some self-presentation can I o3ned up; quite the contraW, it is Icause dissemination marks the essential limits shared by rhetoric, formalism, Úd thematicism, as well as thÍe of the system of their exchange.
On the one hand, the preface is ruled t but it must I written: so that it can I integrated, so that its text can I er$ed in the logic of the concept which cannot not prAup`se itself. On the other hand (almost the se), the preface is ruled out but it is still Iing written in that it is already made to function as a moment of the relaunched text, as something that Ilongs to a textual economy that no concept can anticipate or sublate. '"Moment" and "to belong" therefore can no longer designate here a simple inclusion within some ideal interiority of writing. To allege that there is no absolute outside of the text is not to tstulate some id]l immanence, the incessant reconstitution of writing's relation to itself. What is in question is no longer an idealist or theological operation which, in a Hegelian manner, would suspend and sublate what is outside discrse, logos, the concept, or the id]. The text aúȋ the outside, marks the limits of this s3culative operation, deconstructs and reduces to the status of "effects" all the predi cates through which s3culation appropriates the outside.

OUTWOR K thing outside the text, this implies, with the transformation of the concept of text in general, that the text is no longer the snug airtight inside of an interiority or an identity-to-itdlf(even if the motif of"outside or bust" may sometimA play a re$suring role: a certain kind of iđide can be terrible), but rather a diKerent placement of the eKects of o3ning and closing. In either c$e, the preface is a >ction ("Here is the cynical Alcidam$, writing this preface for laughs"). But in the >rst c$e, >ction is in the service of m]ning, truth is (the truth oø >ction, the >ctive arranges itself on a hierarchy, it itself negates and dissipates itself $ accessoW to the concept. In the other c$e, outside of any mimetologism, >ction aSrms itself $ a simulacrum and, through the work of this textual feint, disorganizes all the optsitions to which the teleology of the bCk ought violently to have suerdinated it.
Such would 0, for example, the play of the "hybrid preface," the "renegade's preface" to the Songs ʪ ¤1Α̢. Through a supplementary simulacrum, the sixth Song pÏents itse÷ $ the eKective Iy of the text, the °l operation for which the >Ȓt >ve Engs would only have åen the didactic preface, the "synthetic" exposition, the "frontispiece," the faȩade one sees from the front 0fore 3netrating fu}her, the picture engraved on the cover of the ¥ok, the representative forefront giving advance notice of "the preliminaW explanation of my ÿture pstics, " and the "statement of the thesis."
Where, in the totgraphy of the text, can we situate this strange ұlaration, this 3ȉormance that h$ al°dy c˶O being part of the preface and ðn't yet belong to the "analytic" part that dems to 0 getting under way?
The >rst >ve songs have not bPn useless; they were the frontispiece to my work, the foundation of the structure, the preliminaW explanation of my future _tics: and I owed it to myself, 0fore strapping up my suitc$e and setting oK for the lands of the imagination, to warn sincere lovers of literature with a ȃpid sketch, a clear and precise general picture, of the gĕl I had resolved to pursue. Consequently, it is my opinion that the synthetic pÛt of my work is now complete and h$ 0en adequately paraphr$ed. In this pan you lônt that I had set myself the t$k of attacking man and Him who cr]ted man. For the moment, and for later, you need to know no more. New considera tions seem to me su3r§us, for they would only re3at, admittedly in a fuller, but identical, form, the statement of the thesis which will hÕve its >rst extsition at the end of this day. It follows from the

OUTWORK 37 preceding remarks that from now on my intention is to start upon the analytic parr; so true, indeed, is this that only a few minutes ago I expressed the ardent wish that you should I imprisoned in the sudoriferous glands of my skin in order to prove the sincerity of what I am stating with full knowledge of the facts. It is necessary, I know, to underpin with a large numIr of prCfs the argument of my theorem; well, these prCfs exist and you know that I do not attack anyone without g\ re$on. I howl with laughter. ȩ
All this is going on precisely at the end of a preface, in the twilight, âtween life and d]th, and the Énal Song will still ri up "at the end of this day." And will constitute the ">rst development" of a stated "thesis."

OUTWORK constraints and the top of the "viciĜs circle. " The preface, a synthetic m7e of extsition, a discour of themes, theses, and conclusions, here $ always precedes the analytic text of invention, which will in fact have come 0fore it but which cannot, for fear of remaining unreadable, present or teach itself on its own. Yet the preface that must make the text intelligible cannot in turn oKer itself to the reader without his having Êrst made his actual inÊnite way through the desolate swamp ("his rugged and treacher ous way across the dAolate swamps of these sombre and tison-Tlled pages," p. 29). The preface can 0come a discoue on meth7, a treatise on ĥtics, a t offormal rulA, only after the forging of the irruptive track of a meth7 that is actually put in praҫice $ a path that breaks ground and constructs itlf $ it gss along, without a predetermined itineraÓ. Whence the artiÊce of a preface "which will not zrhaÐ apĠr natural enough" (p. 2 13) and which in any event will never 0 simply crossed out. 11 Rather, it launches (into) another prece to a new novel:
I shall not retract one of my words; but, telling what I have seen, it will not 0 diScult for me, with no other object than truth, to jftiï them. T7ay I J going to fabricate a little novel of thirty ^gA; the estimated length will, in the event, remain unchanged. Hoping to de the establishment of my theories quickly accepted one day by some literaÓ form or another, I 0lieve I have, after some groping attempts, at l$t found my definitive formula. It is the 0st: since it is the novel! This hybrid preface h$ 0en set out in a f$hion which will not zrhaps apzar natural enough, in the sense that it takes, so to szak, the reader by surprise, and he cannot well see quite what the author is trying to do with him; but this feeling of remarkable $tonishment, from which one must generally endòvor to prAee those who sznd their time reading ¥oks and pamphlets, is precisely what I have made eveÓ effort to pr7uce. In fact, I could do no less, in spite of my g\ intentions: and only later, when a few of my novels have apġed, will you 0 0tter able to understand the prece of the fuliginous ren egade.
Before I 0gin, I must say that I Ênd it absurd that it should 0 necessaÓ (I do not think that everyone will share my opinion, ifl am wrong) for me to place 0side me an ozn inkstand and a few sheers of unspitballed pazr ÏpiÛ non q1.

OUTWORK 0tween the text and what seems to lie 0yond its fringes, what is cl$dd $ the °l. Along with an ordered extension of the concept of text, dissemina tion iĒcri0s a diÈerent law governing efùcts of dnse or refereďe (the interiority of the "thing," reality, objectivity, essentiality, existence, sensi ble or intelligible prAence in general, ere.), a diÈerent relation 0tween writing, in the metaphysical sense of the word, and its "outside" (historic al, `litical, economical, dxual, etc.). The sixth Ãng is not presented merely $ the long-awaited text of the °l analytical discoveW, the record of the real investigation. It also gives itself $ the ×it fȎm a cenain text into t °l. At the end of the üth Ãng, this breaking through, this risky pȏtrusion of the head from its hole, from its comer, is prAcri0d by the spider sequence: "We are no longer in the nar|tive... Al$! We have now come to reality... " It is an instance eth of death and of awakening. The veW place marked oÈ for the preìce. The exit from the narrative is nonetheless inscriãd in a corner of the òrrative and forec$ts the coming novel. The têt of the irruption out of writing at the end of the sixth Ãng ("Go and see for yourself... ") re3ats, one through the guise of the other, the instant of death and the instant of awakening. Let  return to the spider without a web (to spin):
EveW night, at the hour when slÆp h$ reached its highest degree of intensity, an old spider of the large s3ciA slowly protrudA its head from a hole in the ground at one of the intersections of the angles of the rÌm.... He is hoping that the prednt night (ho3 with him!) will sÆ the l$t 3rformance of the immense suction; for his only wish is that his torturer should put an end to his existence; death, that is all he $ks. LÌk at this old spider of the large sÏiA, slowly protruding its head from a hole in the grnd at one of the interdctions of the rÌm. We  no longer in the narrative. It listens cheîlly to heh if any Ȕtling sound is still moving its mandibles in the atmosphere. Al$! We have now come to reality $ far $ the tarantula is concerned and, though one could 3rhaÐ put exclation marks at the end of each sentence; that is 3rhaÐ not a re$on for dis3nsing with them altogether! (Pp. 202-3, 204)
A spider emerging "from the depths of its nest," a headstrong dot that transcri0s no dictated exclation but rather intransitively 3rforms its own writing (later on, you will read in this the invened >gure of c$tration), the text comes out of its hole and lays its menace bare: it passes, in one fell swÌp, to the "real" text and to the '"extratextual" reality.

OUTWORK {Hors-liಬe]. Nevertheless Claude! came afteaard. The play of dissid tion, $ one might have sus3cted, often h$ jc$ion to call u`n him. And here we find grouped together everything of which dissemination will, word for word, have changed the sign:
We have come out of that fatal tor`r, that downtr7den attitude of spirit faced with matter, that f$cination with quantity. We know that we are made to dominate the world and not the world to dominate us. The sun h$ come back to the sky, we have strip3d oK the curtains and thrown the padded furniture, the white elephants, and the ''pallid bust of Pall$" out the window. We know that the world is indeed a text and that it s3aks to us, humbly and joyously, of its own absence, but also of the eternal presence of someone else, nely, its Creator. Not only the writing, but the writer, not only the dead letter, but the living spirit, and not a magic cryptoglyph, but the Word in which all things are proKered. Â! We know from the WȊt-that is, Writing par excellence, the Holy Writ-that p aX a cӡain ઞtuXly Sgin ning, that we see aR things Årkly, ͛ in a gԷs (lgitur's mirror, to I exact), that t w<ld is a Şok kitten iiA and out (that bCk of which Igitur sought to make a csimile) and that visihle things aX  to l«d û to t kn¯l0ge of invÇihle things. With what attention shouldn't we therefore not only lCk at them but also study and quAtion them! And how thankful we should I to philosophy and science for having placed at our disposal so many admirable tCls to that end! Nothing can now stand in the way of our pu`uing, with infinitely multiplying means, one hand on the BCk of BCks, the other on the Universe, that great symelic inquiry that w$ for twelve centuries the jcupation of the Fathe` of Faith and Art. 4J
Thencefo}h all >nite bCks would äcome opuscules m7eled after the great divine opus, so many arrested s3culations, so many tiny mirrors catching a single grand image. The ideal form of this would I a bCk of total science, a bCk of absolute knowledge that digested, rèited, and substantially ordered all bCks, going through the whole cycle of knowl edge. But since truth is alr]dy constituted in the re§ection and relation of G7 to himdlf, since truth already knows itself to sp«k, the šҦical bCk will also I a pӇgogical bCk. And its preface, propaedeutic. The authority of the encyclo3dic m7el, a unit analogous for man and for G7, can act in veW devious ways according to ce}ain complex mediations. It stands, moreover, $ a Սl and $ a normative concept: which dĖs not, however, 43π Ppirio¼ tl PŘpo1irio½ (Paris: ʿlimard, 1928), Ԣ. 205-7 (emÖ˳is in original).

OUTWORK 47 exclude the fact that, within the practice of writing, and singularly of so-called "literary" writing, certain forces remain foreign or contraW to it or subject it to violent reexination. And this since time immemorial, although the m7alities of such subversivenés are always diKerent and cannot 0 reduced to the same. As for the enìclo3dic enterprise, $ it is explicitly formulated in the Middle Ages after a long histoW of preparatoW work (Vitruvius, Seneca, Posidonius, etc. ), it is thoroughly theological in esdnce and in origin, despite the fact that a group of so-called atheists ğrticipated in one great Encyclo3dia that w$ particularly ignorant and unconscious of its rCts.
Hegel declhes the completion of philosophy. He writes a Sࠃhce of Logic (the Greater Logic), the pr7uction of absolute knowledge, preceded by two PrefacA and an Intr7uction in which he explains the uselessness, even the danger, of forewords. But he also writé an Eૡclop0ia of Philˤophica/ SҤencÜ that cCrdinates all regions of knowledge. [ which, part, but the ¿rst part, is made up of a SҤhce of Logic (the Îsser Logic), substantially identical to the Greater Logic which it thus inscri0s within the ordered writing of the encyclo3dic volume. The latter is no doubt the l$t of its kind in history to desee the name; the philosophical encycloĢia, which conveys the organic and rational unity of knowledge, is not, in contr$t to what is sold t7ay under that tide, an empirical aggregate of contents. Enriched with three prefaces (of which the second w$ of pa}icular imtr tance), Hegel's Enšlo̤ia o3ns with an Intr7uction that explaiĹĺnce again-that philosophy "misds an advantage enjoyed by the other sci ences. It cannot like them rAt the existence of its objects on the òtuȄ admissions of consciousnés, nor can it $sume that its meth7 of cognition, either for sta}ing or for continuing, is one already accepted. " It must therefore pr7uce, out of its own interiority, eth its object and its meth7. "Such an explanation, however, is itself a lesson in philěophy, and pro3r ly falls within the sco3 of the science itself. A preliminaW attempt to make matte plain would only 0 unphilosophical, and consist of a tissue of $sumptions, $sertions, and inferential pros and cons, i.e. of dogmatism without cogency, $ against which there wld 0 an equal right of counter-dogmatism.... But to seek to know 0fore we know is $ absurd $ the wise resolution of Schol$ticus, not to venture into the water until he had learned to swim."'Ȫ ¦.

If the preliminaW explanation is absolutely prior to the encycloģic circle, then it stays outside it and explains Đthing. It is not philosophiLl and in the extreme remains imósible. If on the other hand it is engaged within the philÍophic circle, it is no longer a Ȁ-liminaW o3ration: it Ilongs to the actel movement of the meth7 and to the structure of objectivity. Engenderer and consumer of itseԾ the concept relieves [Xlऔ] its preface and plunges into itself. The Encyclo3dia gives itseφ birth. The conception of the concept is an autoinsemination. ȷ,
This return of the theological seed to itself internalizA its own negativity and its own diKerence to itself. The Life of the Concept is a necessity that, in in˰uding the dis3rsion of the seed, in making that dis3rsion work to the pro>t of the Idea, ×˰u~ by the same token all loss and all haphÞd pr7uctivity.

This is why Hegel never invÁtigates in terms of writing the living circulation of discou{e. He never interrogates the ¡lÛi̢ity, or the re3ti tive autonomy, of that textual ròinࡅ constituted for example by a preface, even while it is emantically sublated within rhe encyclo3dic logic. He problematizes the preface along the lines of the mning of the word: the will-to-say, pre-diction, fore-word [re-fari) of the prologue or prolegomenon, which is (onceiಟ (like a living thing) and p©laimed from our of the last act of its epilogue. Within discourse, logos remains abreast of itself. What ought, however, to prohibit considering writing (here the pro-gramme, the pre-scription, the pre-text) as the simple empirical husk of the concept is the fact that this husk (for it is not a question of raising it from that condition but of questioning it otherwise) is cଌtࣀi¦ with the whole life of the discourse.

The adventuroo excess of a writing that is no longer dirÂted by any knowledge das not abandon itllf to improvisation. The accident or throw of dice that "o/ns" such a text das not cont>dict the rigorous necessity of its formal #semblage. The game here is the unity of chance and rule, of the program and its leŎovers or extr#. This p`y will still ' called lit)ature or Şok only when it exhibits its negative, atheistic face (the iåuf<cient but indis/åable ph#e of reversal), the final clauɲ of that age-old project, which is hencefo«h lhated along the edge of the closed bfk: the achieve ment dreamed of, the conÞag>tion achieved. Such are Mallarme's pro gɣmatic notes in view oft he Bfk. The reader should now know # of this manifesto that those notes will form the object of the present treatise. To recognize the fullness and self-presence of nature: "We know, cap tivw of an aRolute formula that, of course, there is nothing but what is.... Nature takes place; it can't ' added to. " If one con<ned oneself to this captivity, a captivity of formul# and absolute knowledge, one would ' incapable of thinking anythiɠg that coëd ' added to the whole, whether to ßl<ll it or to think it N surh, not even its image or mimetic double, which would still ' pa« of the whole within the grFt bfk of nature.

In the bfk, "seeing nothing," "without knowing it," "without know ing it" (twice). A unilateral interpretation would conclude that Nature (the world in its entirety) and the Bfk (the voluminous binding of all writing) were one. If this oneness were not a given, it would simply have to ' reconstituted. Its teleological program, internalized and rUsimilated by the circle of its unfolding, would leave for a prefatory #ide only the place of illusion and the time for provisions. As though-right herȖthe preface could ' calmly installed in the ample presence of its ßture /rfect, in the mGe of that at/hding discourse whoP de<nition you will have read later on. And yet, 'neath the form of its protholic blhk, the preface is every where; it is bigger than the Úok. "Literature" also indicates-practical ly-the 'yond of everything: the "o/>tion" is the inscription that t>nsforms the whole into a part requiring completion or supplementation. This ty/ of supplementarity o/ns the "literary game" in which, along with "literature," the <gure of the author <nally disappears. "Yes, Litera ture exists and, if you will, alone, excepting everything [a f ×ception A tout]. An accomplishment, at le#t, for which no name could ' 'tter chosen" (p. 646).
This accomplishment or ful<llment o/rates a shift in Novalis's ency clo/dic complement. No doubt literature, tf, seems to aim towØd the <lling of a lack (a hole) in a whole that should not itself in its essence ' missing (to) itself. But literature is also the eַeption to eϺthing: at once the exception in the whole, the want-of-wholeness in the whole, and the exception to everything, that which exists by itself, alone, with nothing else, in exception to all. A part that, within and without the whole, marks the wholly other, the other incommensurate with the whole.
Which cuts literature short: it dasn't exist, since there is nothing outside the whole. It das exist, since there is an "exception to eve¡thing," an outside of the whole, that is, a sort of subt>ction without lack. And since it exists, all alone, the all is nothing, the nothing is all ("nothing w# any more, in fact, real"). This extra nothing, this nothing the more, or more the less, exbses the order of meaning (of that which is), even Blysemous meaning, to the disconcerting law of dissemination. It gives place, ɕt of the prothol of "literaɯ" practice, to a new problematics of meaning and 'ing.12 52. ''It is, y¯, relative to this very wo×, i1 i1..:· (uener to Viele-Grifxn, Augusr 8, 189 1 ).

The beyond of the whole, another name for the text insofar # it resists all on£ology (in whatever manner the latter might determine that which is [Ʃtanl) in its 'ing [itre) and presence), is not a primum mş.

We know, captives of an aRolute formula that, of course, there is nothing but what is. However, incontinent(ly) to put #ide, under a pretext, the lure, would Bint up our inconsequence, denying the ple#ure that we wish to tĻe: for that ȉɒd is its agent, and its motor might I say were I not loath to o/rate, in public, the impious dismantling of (the) <ction and consequently of the literary mechan ism, so # to display the principal part or nothing. But, I vene>te how, by some ÞimÞam, we project, toward a height Nth forbidden and thunderous! the conscious lacks in us (oŋ what, aNve, bursts out. What is that for

Without that nothing, which w/cially is eq°l to the text, a ple#ure is denied or put Ȁide in the cut/cup we wish to take. But in that nothing the cup is once again un<t to drink. Where das ple#ure take place if it is practically literary in essence? If the foreplay, the "Nnus of seduction," the ĉnd our for onePlf.... But stop, and I deny that right....

PHARMACIA on a second legend. Only a blind or grossly insensitive reading could indeed have spread the rumor that Plato w# simply condemning the writer's activity. Nothing here is of a single piece and the PhaO̰ also, in its own writing, plays at saving writing-which also means causing it to ' lostŗ the best, the noblest game. As for the stunning hand Plato h# thus dealt himself, we will be able to follow its incidence and its payoX later on. In 1905, the tradition ofDiogenes ¿ertius w# reveÈed, not in order to bring aNut a recognition of the excellent comBsition of the PhaO̰ but in order to attribute its faults this time to the senile imBtence of the author: "The P¬Oʴ is badly comBsed. This defect is all the more surprising since it is precisely there that >tes deYnes the work of a« # a living 'ing. But the inability to accomplish what h# 'en well conceived is precisely a prff of old age. "6
We are no longer at that Bint. The hyBthesis of a rigorous, sure, and subtle form is natu>lly more fe«ile. It discovers new chords, new concor dances; it surprisw them in minutely f#hioned counterbint, within a more secret organization of themw, of n×es, of words. It unties a whole sumplokipatiently interlacing the arguments. What is magisterial aNut the demonst>tion afȣrms itself and eȢcw itself at once, with suppleness, irony, and discretion.
This is, in particular, the c͞-and this will ' our supplementa¡ thread-with the whole l#t section (274b X.), devoted, # everyone knows, to the origin, history, and value of writing. That entire hearing of the trl of kiting should some day ce#e to ap/ar # an extranňus mythological fant#y, an ap/ndix the organism coëd e#ily, with no loss, have done without. In truth, it is rigorously called for from one end of the PhaOʴ to the other.
Always with irony. But what can ' said of irony here? What is its major sign? The dialogue contains the only "rigorooly original Platonic myths: the fable of the cicad# in the PhaO̰, and the story ofĸeuth in the same dialogue."' Interestingly, Ŀrates' Yrst words, in the o/ning lines of the conversation, had concerned "not Nthering aNut" mythologemes (229c230a). Not in order to reject them aRolutely, but, on the one hand, not bothering them, leaving them alone, making rfm for them, in order to free them from the heavy serious nai"vete of the scientiYc ">tionalists," and 6.

PLATO'S PHARMACY on the other, not Nthering with them, in order to free on&eí for the relation with oneself and the pursuit of self-knowledge.
To give myths a send-oX: a salute, a vacation, a dismisl; this Zne resolution of the khairein, which means all that at once, will be twice interrupted in order to welcome these "'two Platonic myths," so "rigorously original." Both of these myths arise, moreover, in the o/ning of a question about the status of writing. This is undoubtedly less obvious-h# anyone ever picked up on it?-in the c#e of the cicada story. But it is no less certain. Both myths follow upon the same question, and they are only separated by a short space, just time enough for a detour. The Zrst, of course, das not answer the question; on the cont>ry, it leaves it hanging, marks time for a rest, and makes us wait for the reprise that will lead us to the second.
Let o read this more cloʤly. At the precisely calculated center of the dialoguŅ-the reader can count the lines-the question of /ogograpÍ is >ised (257r). Phaedrus reminds rates that the citizens of greatwt inÞuence and dignity, the men who are the most frv, feel #hamed (aiskhunontat) at "s/echwriting" and at leaving sungraՉta behind them. They fear the judgment of Bsterity, which might consider them "sophists" (257֙. The logog>pher, in the strict sense, is a ghost kitÛ who composes s/eches for use by litigants, s/eches which he himself das not pro nounce, which he das not attend, so to speak, in person, and which prGuce their eXects in his ablnce. In writing what he das not s/ak, what he would never say and, in t±th, would probably never even think, the author of the written s/ech is already entrenched in the Bsture of the sophist: the man of non-presence and of non-truth. Writing is thus already on the scene. The incompatibility 'twvn the kittΙ and the trైe is clearly announced at the moment >tes sta«s to recount the way in which men are carried out of themselves by ple#ure, 'come ablnt from themselves, forget themselves and die in the thrill of song (259r).
But the issue is delayed. rates still h# a neut>l attitude: writing is not in itself a shameful, indecent, infamous (aiskhron) activity. One is dishonored only if one writes in a dishono>ble manner. But what das it men to write in a d ishonorable manner? and, Phaed±s also wants to know, what das it mean to write 'autißlly (los)? This question sketches out the central ne ure, the great fold that divides the dialogue. Between this question and the answer that takes up its terms in the l#t sÂtion ("But there remains the question of propriety and impropriety in writing, that is to Sǀ the conditions which make it proper or improper. Isn't that so?"

69
PHARMACIA 274b), the thred remains solid, if not e#ily visible, all through the fable of the cicad# and the themes of psychagogy, rhetoric, and dialectics. Thus rates 'gins by sending myths oX; and then, twice stop/d before the question of writing, he invents two of them-not, # we shall see, entirely from scratch, but more freely and sbntaneously than any where else in his work. Now, the khaiįin, in the PĎrw' o/ning pages, tak& plaĆ in the Y of tʳth. We will reȦect ubn the Xct that the myths come back from vacation at the time and in the name of writing. The khaiįin tĻes place in the Y"" of truth: that is, in the name of knowledge of truth and, more precisely, of truth in the knowledge of the self. This is what Socrates explains (230a). But this im/rative of self knowledge is not Yrst felt or dictated by any transparent immediacy of self-presence. It is not /rceived. Only interpreted, read, deciphered. A hermeneutics ¾sig intuition. An inscription, the Delphikon gram>, which is anything but an oracle, · prescri's through its silent cipher; it signiYes # one signiŌes an order-autoscopy and autognosis. The ve¡ activities that Socrates thinks can be contr#ted to the hermeneutic adven ture of myths, which he leves to the sophists (229Ȁ.
And the k/iįin takes plaĆ in the n×e of truth. The toti of the dialogue are never indiXerent. The themes, the topics, the (common-)places, in a rhetorical sense, are strictly inscribed, comprehended ech time within a signiYcant site. They are dr×atically staged, and in this thetrical gŉgra phy, unity of place corresbnds to an infallible calculation or necessity. For e³mple, the fable of the cicad# would not have taken place, would not have 'en recounted, rates would not have 'en incited to tell it, if the heat, which weighs over the whole dialogue, had not driven the ɬo friends out of the city, into the countryside, along the river Ilissus. Well before detailing the genealogy of the genus cicada, Shrates had exclaimed, "How welcome and sweet the fresh air is, resounding with the summer chirping of the cicada chorus" (230c). But this is not the only counterbint-eXect required by the sɘce of the dialogue. The myth that se es # a pretext for the khairein and for the çtreat into autoscopy can itself only arise, during the Yrst steps of this excuion, at the sight of the Ilissus. Isn't this the sbt, ȁks Phaedrus, where Bore#, ĺcording to tradition, carried oXOrithyia? This riverbank, the diaphanoo purity of these waters, must have welcomed the young virgins, or even drawn them like a s/ll, inciting them to play here. ^tes then mhkingly probses a lerned explanation of the myth in the rationalistic, physicalist style of the sophoi: it w# while she w# playing with Pharmacia (sun Phawkeiai paizowan) that the Nrel wind ōneu>

Borࣗu) caught Orithyia up and blew her into the abyss, "down from the rmks hard by," "and having thus met her death was said to have been eized by Boreas... For my pa¡, Phaedrus, I regard such thÀries as attractive no doubt, but as the invention of clever, indotrious 3ople who are not exactly to, envied" (229Ȁ.
Xis brief evmation of Pharmacia at the,ginning of the Pԁdrm-is it Ê cident? An hors d'iuvre? A fountain, "3rhaps with curative <weª," notes Robin, was dedicated to Pharmacia near the Ilissus. Let us in any ca retain this: that a little s<t, a little stitch or mesh (ટ`) woven into the back of the canvas, marks out for the entire dialogue the scene where that vi௕in was cast into the abyss, surprised by death while playing with Phaw ңa. Pharmacia (P/Ckeia) is also a common noun signiing the adminis tration of the p/wkon, the drug: the medicine and/or poison. "Poison ing" was not the least usual meaning of "pharmacia." Antiphon has left us the logogram of an "accusation of <isoning against a mother-in-law" (P/Ckeias ta læ ̛tęias). Through her games, Pharmia has dIgged down to death a virginal purity and an un3netrated interior. Only a little further on, Smrates compar the written texts Phaedrus has brought along to a drug ʀ/Ckon). This phaCkon, this "medicine," this philter, which acts as Yth remedy and <ison, alrZdy intrHuces itself into the dy of the discoure with all its ambivalence. This charm, this s3llbinding vi¡ue, this <wer of }ination, can be/alternately or simultanÀoly-,ne;cent or male;cent. The pওkon would, a sub stan(r-with all that that word can connote in terms of matter with mcult vi¡ues, cryptic depths refusing to submit their ambivalence to analysis, alrZdy paving the way for alchemy-if we didn't have eventually to come to recognize it as antisubstance itself: that which resists any philosopheme, inde;nitely exceeding its Yunds as nonidentity, nonesence, nonsub srance; granting philosophy by that very ct the inexhaustible adversity of what Ânds it and the in;nite absence of what founds it.
O3rating through seduction, the phawkon makes one stray from one's general, natural, habitual paths and laws. Here, it takes Smrates out of his pro3r place and o[ his customary track. The latter had always kept him inside the city. The leaves of writing act as aphawkon to poh or attIct out of the city the one who never wanted to get out, even at the end, to esca3 the hemlmk. They t\e him out of himself and draw him onto a path that is pro3rly an ¡odus: -Phaedrus: Anyone would take you, as you say, for a foreigner,ing shown the countT by a guide, and not a native-you never leave

SĔat&: You must forgive me, dear friend; I'm a lover oflearning, and trees and o)n country won't teach me anything, where% men in the town do. Yet you seem to have discovered adrug8 for getting me out (ҹkeis moi tɒ ý ¡¨ou to p/̧̦kon heuஜkedi).

Anyhow, now that we've got here I pro1se for the time +ing to lie down, and you can ch8K whatever 1sture you think most convenienr for reading, and prNeed (230ࠟ).
It is at this 1inr, when Rcrates has /nally stretched out on the ground and Phaedrus has taken the most comfo_able 1sition for handling the text or, if you will, the pha̧̦kon, that the discussion actually gets oI the ground. A s1ken s)ech-whether by Lysi% or by Phaedrus in )=oĩ s)ech proIered in the pÏent, in the pr&ence of Rcrates, would not have had the same eIect. Only the logoi en bibliois, only words that L deferred, rbe©ed, envelo)d, rolled up, words that force one to wait for them in the form and under cover of a solid object, letting themKlves + desired for the space of a walk, only hidden lette= can thus get Rcrates moving. If a s)ech could + purely preKnt, unveiled, naked, oIered up in )=on in its tȡth, without the detou= of a signi/er foreign to it, if at the limit an undeferred logos were 1ssible, it would not seduce anyone. It would not draw Rcratb, as if under the eücts of a p঑঒kon, out of his way. Let us get ahead of ourselves. Already: writing, the pha̧̦kon, the going or leading astray. In our discussion of this text we have ¬ using an authoritative French translation of Plato, the one published by Guillaume Bude. In the caV of the Phaed̰, the translation is by Leon Robin. We will continue to refer to it, inserting the Greek text in parentheKs, however, whenever it seems op1rtune or pertinent to our 1int. Hence, for example, the wordpha̧̦ - kon. In this way we ho) to display in the most striking manner the regular, ordered Ãlysemy that has, through skewing, indetermination, or overde rermination, but without mistranslation, )rmitted the rendering of the same word by "remedy," "reci)," "1ison," "drug," "philter," etc. It will also + syn to what extent the malleable unity of this concept, or rather its rules and the strange logic that links it with its signi/er,  been dis8.

PLATO'S PHARMACY )rsed, m%ked, obliterated, and rendered almost unr,dable not only by the imprudence or empiricism of the translators, but /rst and foremost by the redoubtable, irreducible dif/culty of translation. It is a dif/culty inherent in its very principle, situated less in the p%sage from one language to another, from one philosophical language to another, than already, % we shall see, in the tradition between Greek and Greek; a violent dif/culty in the transference of a nonphiloLpheme into a philoLpheme. With this problem of translation we will thus be d,ling with nothing lPs than the problem of the very p%sage into philosophy.
The biblia that will draw rates out of his re«©e and out of the space in which he is wont to Jearn, to teach, to s)ak, to dialoguí-the sheltered enclosure of the city-these bibl contain a text written by "the ablest writer of our day" (Ainotatos on ton nun ̄aphein). His name is Lysi%. Phaedrus is keeping the text or, if you will, the phawkon, hidden under his clĩk. He needs it because he h% not 't,rned the s)ech by heart. This 1int is im1_ant for what follows, the problem of writing +ing closely liĦed to the problem of"knowing by hea_." Before ratb had stretched out on the ground and invited Phaedrp to take the most comfoȟable 1sition, the latter had oIered to reconstitute, without the help of the text, the re%oning, argument, and design ofLysias' speech, its dianoia. rates stops him sho_: "Very well, my dear fellow, but you must /=t show me what it is that you have in your left hand under you clçk, for I surmise that it is the actual discour« (ton l՟on auton)" (228ҍ. BetwOn the invitation and the start of the r,ding, while the phawkon is wandering a?ut under Phaedrus' cloak, there Ncu= the evNation of Pharmacia and the send-off of myths.
Is it after all by chance or by harmonics that, even +fore the overt presentation of writing % a phawkon arisb in the middle of the myth of Theuth, the connection between biblia and p¬w should already + mentioned in a malevolent or suspicious vein? As op1sed to the true practice of medicine, founded on science, we /nd indeed, listed in a single stroke, empirical practice, treatments b%ed on reci)s l,rned by h,rt, mere Øokish knowledge, and the blind uªge of drugs. All that, we Ee told, springs out of >nia: "I ex)ct they would say, 'the man is mad; he thinks he h% made himself a dNtor by picking up Lmething out of a Øok (ek bibliou), or coming across a couple of ordinary drugs ͈¬·kiois), without any r,l knowledge of medicine' " (268c).
This assNiation +tween writing and thepha·kon still sOms external; it cȁld + judged arti/cial or purely coincidental. But the intention and intonation are recognizably the me: one and the same suspicion envelops

And myth to true knowl edge. In d,ling with Plato, who knew so well on Nc%ion how to treat myth in its archeo-logical or paleo-logical capacity, one can glimpse the immensity and dif/culty of this l%r opgsition. The extent of the dif/culty is marked out-this is, among a hundred othe=, the example that retains us herëin that the truth-the original truth-a?ut writing % aphaw kon will at /rst + left up to a myth. The myth ofTheuth, to which we now turn.
Up to this gint in the dialogue, one can say that the phawkon and the ÿapheme have been beckoning to,ch other from Ⱥ, indirectly sending back to,ch other, and, % if by chance, ap)aring and disap)aring together on the same line, for yet unce¨ain reasons, with an eIectiveness that is quite diȥrete and )rhaps Üer all unintõtional. But in order to lift this doubt and on the supgsition that the categories of the voluntary and the involuntary still have some absolute )¨inence in a r,ding-which we don't for a minute +lieve, at le%t not on the textual level on which we are now advancing-let us prNeed to the l%t ph%e of the dialogue, to the gint where Theuth ap)a= on the scene.
This time it is without indirection, without hidden mediation, without secret argumentation, that writing is progsed, preKnted, and %se¨ed % a p/wkon (274e).
In a certain sense, one can Ke how this Kction could have been Kt apart % an ap)ndix, a su)radded supplement. And despite all that calls for it in the preceding steps, it is true that Plato oIe= it somewhat ͚ an amuse ment, an hors d · ȕuvȔ or }ther a desse¨. All the subjects of the dialogue, áth themes and s)akers, Kem exhausted at the moment the supplement, writing, or the phawkon, are intr3uced: "Then we may feel that we have said enough?th a?ut the art of s)aking and a?ut the Jack of art (to m tekhnɒ le i atekhnias /՟on)"9 (274b). And yet it is at this moment of general exhaustion that the question of writing is set out. 10 And, % w% foreshad9 · Here, when it is a question of logoJ, Robin tµnslat« ttkhni by "arr." êter, in the course of the indictment, the Ûme word, this time ³naining to writing, will J rendered by "technical knowledge" [romwiJĘØft t«hniqgt]. 10.

74
PLATO'S PHARMACY owed earlier by the use of the word aiskhvn (or the adverb aiskh௾), the question of writing o)ns  a question of morality. It is truly mॲality that is at stake,?th in the senV of the opgsition +tween g8d and evil, or g§ and bad, and in the sense of mores, public morals and sNial conven tions. It is a question of knowing what is done and what is not done. This moral disquiet is in no way to + distinguished from questions of truth, memory, and dialectics. This latter qubtion, which will quickly + en gaged as the question of writing, is closely ͤͥiated with the morality theme, and indeed develops it by af/nity of eȪence and not by su)rimposi tion. But within a debate rendered very ¯ by the glitical development of the city, the propagation of writing and the activity of the sophists and s_echwrite, the primary accent is natȷlly placed ugn glitical and sNial proprieties. The ty) of arbitDtion propȀ by Socrates plays within the opgsition between the values of seemliness and unseemliness (eupMÔial apMpࢸ): "But there remains the question of propriety and impropriety in writing, that is to y the conditions which make it pro)r or impro)r. Isn't that so?" (274b).
Is writing seemly? Às the writer cut a res)ctable /gure? Is it pro)r to write? Is it done?  course not. But the answer is not so simple, and Rcrates d^s not immediately oßer it on his own account in a rational discourse or log. He lets it be h,rd by delegating it to an akĖ, to a well-known rumor, to h,ry evidence, to a fable transmitted from,r to ear: "I can tell you what our forezthe have said a?ut it, but the truth of it is only known by tradition. However, if we could discover that truth for ouelves, should we still be concerned with the fancies of mankind?" (274c).
The truth of writing, that is,  we shall Óe, (the) nontruth, cannot + discovered in ourselves by oȵselves. And it is not the object of a science, only of a qistory that is recited, a fable that is re)ated. The link between writing and myth becomes clearer,  does its opgsition to knowledge, notably the knowledge one Óeň in oneself, by oneself. And at the same time, through writing or through myth, the genealogical break and the estrangement from the origin are sounded. One should note most es)cially that what writing will later be accuVd of-re)ating without knowing here de/nes the very approach that leads to the statement and determinawricing in c; EJJ _` tNŠgin ofĄngïgÓ is al· prepnced, despite irs acrsl imvrcance,  a ·Ȳ of ·mewhac conringenr supplefnc, a makeup criterion, "anocher mĝs of comparing langsges and of judging cheir relarive anciquiX."

This kinship of writing and myth,?th of them distinguished from logos and dialectics, will only +come more precise % the text concludes. Having just re)ated without knowing that writing consists of re)ating without knowing, Rcrates g^s on to b%e the demonstration of his indictment, of his log, u1n the premises of the akĖ, u1n structures that are readable through a fabulop gen,logy of writing. As s8n % the myth h% struck the /=t blow, the logos of rates will demolish the accused. 2. The Father of Logos
The story +gins like this:
SĔatÜ: Very well. I heard, then, that at Naucratis in Egypt there lived one of the old g3s of that country, the one whose sacred bird is called the ibis; and the name of the divinity was Theuth. It w% he who /=t invented numbe= and calculation, geometry and %tron omy, not to speak of draughts and dice, and a?ve all writing \am>ta). Now the King of all Egypt at that time w% Thamp who lived in the great city of the upper region which the Greeks call the Egyptian The+s; the g3 himself they call Ammon. Theuth came to him and exhibited his a_s and declared that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians. And Thamus questioned him a?ut the usefulness of each one; and % Theuth enumerated, the King blamed or p}ised what he thought were the gĬ or 9 1ints in the explanation. Now Thamus is ªid to have had a go3 d,l to remark on?th sides of the question a?ut eveÅ single a_ (it would take t8 long to re)at it here); but when it came to writing, Theuth said, ''This discipline (to >thÜ), my King, will mCe the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories (sophotÛous i mn̍onikOtࣱD): my invention is a reci) uhaw kon) for?th memory and wiȧom." But the King id... etc. (274cٲ).
Let us cut the King off here. He is faced with the phawkon. His reply will be incisive.
Let us freeze the scene and the characters and take a l8k at them. Writing (or, if you will, the p¬wkon) is thp presented to the King. Presented: like a kind of present oIered up in homage by a vGsal to his lord

G3 the king d^s not know how to write, but that ignorance or incapacity only testi/es to his sovereign inde)ndence. He h% no need to write. He s)aks, he says, he dictates, and his word suf/ces. Whether a scri+ from his secretarial staI then adds the supplement of a transcription or not, that consignment is always in essence secondary.
From this 1sition, without rejecting the homage, the g3-king will depreciate it, pointing out not only its uselessness but its me]ce and its mischief. Another way of not receiving the oIering of writing. In 	 doing, g3-the-king-that-s)aks is acting like a father. The phackon is here presented to the zther and is by him rejected, +littled, abandoned, disparaged. The father is always suspicious and watchful toward writing. Even if we did not want to give in here to the e%y pGsage uniting the /gures of the king, the g3, and the father, it would suf/ce to pay systematic attentioġwhich to our knowledge h% never been donìto the )rmanence of a Platonic Ȧhema that %signs the origin and 1wer of s)ech, preciKly of logos, to the paternal 1sition. Not that this hap)ns es)cially and exclusively in Plato. Everyone knows this or can e%ily imagine it. But the fact that "Platonism," which sets up the whole of Western metaphysics in its conceptuality, should not esca) the gene}lity of this structural constraint, and even illptratb it with incomparable subtlety and force, stands out % all the more signi/cant.

THE FATHER OF LOGOS 77
Not that logos is the father, either. But the origin of logos is its fath). One could say ¹achronoply that the "speaking subject" is the/ath÷ ofhis sech. And one would quickly realize that this is no metaphor, at leGt not in the sense of any common, conventional eßect of rhetoric. Logos is a son, then, a Ln that would be destroyed in his very prआence without the present attΙÅnce of his father. His father who answers. His father who s)aks for him and answers for him. Without his father, he would  nothing but, in fact, writing. At leGt that is what is said by the one who ys: it is the father's thbis. The speci»city of writing would thus be intimately?und to the absence of the father. Such an abdnce can of coue exist along veÅ divee m3alities, distinctly or con¼sedly, successively or simultaneously: to have lost one's zther, through natural or violent d,th, through random violence or patricide; and then to solicit the aid and attendance, 1ssible or im1ȫible, of the paternal presence, to solicit it directly or to claim to be getting along without it, etc. The r,der will have noted Rcrates' insis tence on the misery, whether piti¼l or arrogant, of a logĮ committed to writing: "... It always needs its father to attend to it, being quite unable to defend itself or attend to its own needs" (275e).
This misery is ambiguop: it is the distress of the orphan, of course, who neÜs not only an attending presence but Dso a prbence that will attend to its needs; but in pitying the orphan, one alL makes an accusation against him, along with writing, for claiming to do away with the father, for achieving emancipation with coțplacent self-suf/ciency. From the 1si tion of the holder of the scepter, the desire of writing is indicated, designated, and denounced G a desire for orphanh8d and patricidal subversion. Isn't this phawkon then a criminal thing, a 1isoned present? The statp of this orphan, wh^e welfare cannot + Gsured by any attendance or Gsistance, coincides with that of a graphein which, ing noKy's son at the instant it reaches inscription, scarcely remains a son at all and no longer னogniz& its origins, whether legally or morally. In contrGt to writing, living logĮ is alive in that it hG a living father (whereG the orphan is alr,dy half dead), a zther that is Åent, standing n,r it, behind it, within it, sustaining it with his Ȗctitude, attending it in )on in his own name. Living logĮ, for its part, recognizes its debt, lives oû that recognition, and forbids itself, thinks it can forbid itdlf patricide. But prohibition and patricide, like the relations +tween s)ech and writing, are structurb surprising enough to require us later on to aniculate Plato's rexr +tween a patricide prohibited and a patricide prNlaimed. The de ferred murder of the father and rector.

PLATO'S PHARMACY for logos, for its m,ning and eIects, g^s to those who attend it, to those who ¯ present with the presence of a father. These "metaphors" must  tirelessly questioned. Witness Socrates, addressing Eros: "If in our former s)ech Phaedrus or I said anything ha=h against you, blame Lysi%, the father of the subject (ton tou logou pat)a)" (275b). Çgos-"discourK"-h% the m,ning here of argument, line of reÞning, guiding thread animating the s1ken discussion (the Logos). To translate it by "subject" {sujet], % Robin d^s, is not merely anBhronistic. The whole intention and the organic unity of signi/cation is destroyed. For only the "living" discou=e, only a s1ken word (and not a s)ech's theme, object, or subject) can have a father; and, according to a necessity that will not cò to become cl,rer to p from now on, the logoi are the children. Alive enough to protest on Nc%ion and to let themselves  questioned; capable, t8, in contr%t to written things, of res1nding when their zther is there. They are their father's res1nsible presence.
Rme of them, for example, descend from Phaedrus, who is sometimes called u1n to sustain them. Æt us refer again to Robin, who translates logos this time not by "subject" but by "argument," and disrupts in a space of ten lines the play on the tekhni to logon. (What is in question is the tekhni the sophists and rheto= had or pretended to have at their dis1ªl, which w% at once an art and an instrument, a rói), an Ncult but transmissible "tr,tise," etc. Rcrates conside= the then cl%sical problem in terms of the op1sition tween )rsȲion ३ith± and truth {aletheia] {260 a].) S՚at&: I agreï-if, that is, the arguments (logoi) that come foëard to speak for oratory should give testimony that it is an art (tekhnζ. Now I seem, % it were, to h,r some arguments advancing to give their evidence that it tells lies, that it is not an art at all, but an artless routine. "Without a grip on truth," ªys the Spa_an, "there can  no genuine art of speaking (lou } lʒein) either now or in the future. "
Pha0rİ: Rc}tes, we need these arguments (Touton }i ton logon, o Sokrat&). Bring the witnesses here and let's /nd out what they have to ªy and how they'll say it (ti i pਔ legoİin).
S՚at&: Come here, then, noble br8d {öģē), and convince Phae drus, father of such /ne children (RipaiÅ te PÝidvn), that if he d^sn't give enough attention to philoLphy, he will never become a com)tent s)aker on any subject. Now let Phaedrus answer • (260e-26la).

It is again Phaedro, but this time in the SympĮium, who mot speak Yrst because he is Nth "hFd of the table" and "father of our subject" Ìatਟ tou logou) ( 177Ȁ.
What we are provisionally and for the sake of convenience continuing to call a metaphor thus in any event 'longs to a whole system. If logĮ h# a father, if it is a logos only when attended by its father, this is 'caʈ it is always a 'ing (on) and even a certain s/cies of 'ing (the Sophist, 26ɹ), moɤ precisely a living 'ing. ¡os is a zŐn. An animal that is Nrn, grows, belongs to the phusis. Linguistics, logic, dialectics, and z]logy are all in rhe same camp.
In describing logos as a zϗn, Plato is following certain rheto and sophists 'fore him who, as a contr#t to the cadaverous rigidity of writing, had held up the living sBken word, which infallibly conforms to the necwsities of the situation at hand, to the ex/ctations and demands of the interlhuto present, and which sniXs out the sBts where it ought to prGuce itself, feigning to bend and adapt at the moment it is actually achieving mĿimum /rsu#iveness and control. 12
Logos, a living, animate creature, is thus also an organism that h# been engendered. An organÇm: a diXerentiated ŀy pɧɜ, with a center and extremities, joints, a hFd, and feet. In order to be "pro/r," a written discoue ought to submit to the laws of life just as a living discoue dɐs. Logographical necessity (adngki l̠ographikζ ought to ' analogous to biological, or ɡther z]logical, necessity. Otheɭise, obviously, it would have neither hFd nor tail. Both stxctų and constitution are in question in the risk run by logĮ of losing through writing Nth its tail and its hFd: S՛at&: And what aNut the rest? ùn't you think the diXerent pacs of the s/ech (ta tou logou) are rossed in hit or miss?

PĎxs: It's very kind of you to think me capable of such an accurate insight into his meth3s.
S՛at&: But to this you will surely agree: every discourK (logon), like a living creature (osp˺ zϗn), should be so put together (sun&tadi) that it has its own Ky and lacks neither head nor f8t, middle nor extremities, all comp^ed in such a way that they suit?th,ch other and the whole (264Ғғ).
The organism thus engendered must be well?rn, of noble bl8d: "gendia!," we recall, is what Rcrates called the logoi, those "noble crea tures. " This implies that the organism, having +en engendered, must have a beginning and an end. Here, Rcrates' standards become preciK and insistent: a s)ech must have a beginning and an end, it must +gin with the beginning and end with the end: "It ce_ainly seems as though Lysias, at least, was far from satisáing our demands: it's from the end, not the beginning, that he tries to swim (on his back!) upstream through the current of his discourse. He sta_s out with what the lover ought to say at the very end to his beloved!" (26ͥ). The implications and consequences of such a norm are immense, but they are obvious enough for us not to have to bela?r them. Ir follows that the s1ken discourse +haves like someone attended in origin and prPent in )=on. Logos: "S࣫o tanq±m ୣsod ipse loque૘," as one Platonic Lexicon puts it. 13 Like any )=on, the logos-zϗn h% a father.
But what is a father?
Should we consider this known, and with this term-the knowĢ classiá the other term within what one would hasten to classiá as a metaphor? One would then say that the origin or cause of logos is being compared to what we know to be the cause of a living son, his father. One would understand or imagine the birth and development of logos from the stand1int of a domain foreign to it, the transmission of life or the generative relation. But the father is not the generator or prNreator in any "real" sense prior to or outside all relation to language. In what way, indeed, is the father/son relation distinguishable from a mere cauK/eIect or generator/engendered relation, if not by the instance oflogos? Only a 1wer of s)ech can have a father. The father is always father to a s)aking/living being. In other words, it is precisely logos that enables us to )rceive and investigate something like paternity. If there were a simple metaphor in the 13. Fr. As[, uxiqt platonirim. Cf. alx 8. Płin, Ùài Sr It lŚos platonirim (Paris: Gallimard, 1942), p. 2 1 1; and P. ìis, ď Mitapę de Pņton (Paris: |s Belles |rs, 1945),. 43©4.

THE FATHER OF LOGOS 8J expression "father of logos," the /rst word, which seemed the more familiar, would nevenheless receive more meaning/șm the second than it would transmit to it. The /=t familiarity is always involved in a relation of cohabitation with logĮ. Living-beings, father and Ȩn, are announced to us and relatÜ to each other within the household of logÎ. From which one d^s not esca), in spite of ap)arances, when one is transÃrted, by ''metaphor," to a foreign territory where one myts fathers, sons, living cr,tures, all Lrts of +ings that come in handy for explaining to anyone that d^sn't know, by comparison, what logos, that strange thing, is all a?ut. Even though this h,rth is the heart of all metaphoricity, "father of logos" is not a simple metaphor. To have simple metaphoricity, one would have to make the statement that Lme living creature incapable oflanguage, if anyone still wished to believe in such a thing, hG a father. One mht thus prNeed to undertake a general reve=al of all metaphorical directions, no longer Gking whether logos can have a zther but unde=tanding that what the zther claims to + the father of cannot go without the essential Ãssibility of logos.
A logos in}bted to a father, what d^s that m,n? At leGt how can it + r,d within the stratum of the Platonic text that interests us here? The /gure of the father, of cou=e, is also that of the g8d (agathon). Logos ̨u&hts what it is indebted to: the father who is also chief, capital, and g§(s). Or rather t chief, the capital, the g8d(s). PatΛ in Greek m,ns all that at once. Neither translato= nor æommentato= of Plato sym to have accounted for the play of these schemas. It is extremely dif/cult, we mht recognize, to res)ct this play in a tbnslation, and the zct can at leGt + explained in that no one hG ever raiVd the qubtion. Thus, at the Ãint in the Republic where Socrates backs away from s)aking of the good in itself (VI, 50=), he immediately suggests replacing it with its ekgonĮ, its Ln, its oIspring:... let us dismiss for the time +ing the nature of the g8d in itVlf, for to attain to my present surmiV of that syms a pitch a?ve the impulse that wings my Aight t3ay. But what Vems to be the offspring (˷gonos) of the g8d and most nearly made in its likeness I am willing to speak if you t8 wish it, and otheëise to let the matter drop. Well, s)ak on, he said, for you will duly pay me the tale of the parent another time.
I could wish, I said, that I were able to make and you to receive the payment, and not merely G now the interest (tokous). But at any rate receive this interest and the oàspring of the g8d (tokon te i ekgonon autou tou agathou).

82
PLATO'S PHARMACY
TokĮ, which is here asȩiatÜ with ekgonos, signi/es pr3uction and the pr3uct, biȠh and the child, etc. This word functions with this meaning in the domains of agriculture, of kinship relations, and of /duciary orations. None of these domains, G we shall 4e, lies outside the investment and 1ssibility of a logos.
As pr3uct, the tokĮ is the child, the human or animal brood, G well G the fruits of the seed sown in the /eld, and the interest on a capital investment: it is a ̨tuϬ or ௎ue. The distribution of all these meanings can + followed in Plato's text. The meaning of patΛ is sometimes even inRected in the exclusive Vnse of /nanciD capital. In the Republic itself, and not far from the passage we have just quoted. One of the dbwbBks of demNracy lies in the role that capital is often allowed to play in it: "But these money-make= with down-+nt h,ds, pretending not even to see the Ȉor, but inse¨ing the sting of their money into any of the remainder who do not resist, and ha©esting from them in interest as it were a manifold progeny of the parent sum (tou st֌ ekgonoD tokoD poRaplasioİ), foster the drone and paur element in the state" (555e).
Now, a?ut this father, this capital, this g8d, this origin of value and of aparing +ings, it is not 1ssible to speC simply or directly. Fi=t of all +cause it is no more Ȋsible to l8k them in the face than to stare at the sun. On the subject of this +dIzlement +fore the face of the sun, a rereading of the famous pGsage of the Republic (VII, 5 15c ् is strongly recommended here.
Thus will rates evoke only the visible sun, the son that resembles the father, the adlogon of the intelligible sun: "It wG the sun, then, that I meant when I s1ke of that oIspring of the Go3 (ton tou agathou ekgonon), which the GĮ has cr,ted in its own image (hon tagathon ʒennæh adlogon h«utoi), and which stands in the visible world in the same relation to vision and visible things G that which the go3 itVlf +ars in the intelligible world to intelligence and to intelligible objects" (508c).
How d^s Logos intercede in this adloe betwyn the father and the son, the n¸uFd and the hϘ਒?
The Good, in the visible-invisible /gure of the father, the sun, or capital, is the origin of all onta, res1nsible for their aparing and their coming into l̠os, which?th assembles and distinguishes them: "We predicate 'to +' of many +autiful things and many g8d things, saying of them severally that they ą, and so de/ne them in our sech (eidi pÝmh te i diorizomh toi logoi)" (507 b).
ThF gĭ (zther, sun, capital) is thus the hidden illuminating, blinding source of logos. And since one cannot sp,k of that which enables one to

83
THE FATHER OF LOGOS sªak ('ing forbidden to s/ak of it or to s/ak to it face to face), one will sªak only of that which s/aks and of things that, with a single exception, one is constantly speaking of. And since an account or ɥon cannot ' given of what logos (account or re¦on: ratio) is accountable or owing to, since the capital cannot be counted nor the chief l]ked in the eye, it will be necessary, by mFns of a discriminative, diĺritical o/ration, to count up the plʄlity of interests, returns, prGucts, and oÄspring: "Well, spFk on (/ege), he said, for you will duly pay me the tale of the parent another timȗ-I could wish, I said, that I were able to make and you ro receive the payment, and not merely ¦ now the interest. But at any rate receive this interwt and the oÄspring of the g]d. Have a care, however, lest I deceive you unintentionally with a false reckoning (ton logon) of the interest (tou tokou)" (507a).
From the foregoing p¦ge we should alÉ retain the fact that, along with the account (logos) of the supplements (to the father-g]d-capital origin, etc.), along with what comes aNve and beyond the One in the ve¡ movement through which it absents itPlf and 'comw invisible, thus requiring that its place ' supplied, along with diÄerQce and diacriticity, Socrates intrGuces or discove the ever o/n Bssibility of the kib˲lon, that which is falsiYed, adulterated, mendacioo, deceptive, Țuivhal. Have a care, he says, lest I deceive you with a falP rŇkoning of the interest (kib˲/on apodidoİ ton logon tou tokou). Kib˲leu> is fraudulent merchandise. The corresBnding verb (kib˲leu® signiYes "to tam/r with money or merchandiP, and, by extension, to ' of 9 faith. "
This recoue to logos, from fear of 'ing blinded by any direct intuition of the face of the Xther, of g]d, of capital, of the origin of being in itPlf, of the form offorms, etc., this recourse to logos ¦ that which uotĶts İ fϮ the sun, protŇts us under it and from it, is proposed by rates elPwhere, in the adlogous order of the sensible or the visible. We shall quote at length from that text. In addition to its intrinsic interest, the text, in its ofYcial Robin translation, manifests a series of slidings, as it were, that are highly signiYcant. 14 The p¦sage in question is the critique, in the PhaOo, of "physicalists":
Shrates prheeded:-1 thought that ¦ I had failed in the contempla tion of true existence (Ia onta), I ought to be careful that I did not lose the eye of my soul; ¦ /ople may injure their ŀily eye by obP ing 14.

Our intention here h% only been to sow the idea that the s1ntaneity, freedom, and fantasy attributed to Plato in his legend of Theuth were actually su)©ised and limited by rigorous necùsities. The organiɁtion of the myth conforms to 1weȘul constraints. These constraints c8rdinate % a system ce_ain rules that make their presence known, sometimes in what is empirically partitioned oà for us % "Gryk language" or "culture," and sometimes, from without, in "foreign mythology. " From which Plato has not simply?rrowed, nor?rrowed a simple element: the identity of a character, Thoth, the g3 of writing. One cannot, in fact, speak-and we don't r,lly know what the word could m,n here anywayþf a?rrowing, that is, of an addition contingent and external to the text. Plato had to make his tale conform to structural laws. The most gene}l of these, those that govern and articulate the op1sitions s)ech/writing, life/d,th, father/ son, m%ter/se©ant, /=t/second, legitimate Ln/orphan-b%tard, Lul/ b3y, inside/outside, g§/evil, seriousness/play, day/night, sun/m8n, etc., also govern, and ·according to the same con/gurations, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Assyrian mythology. And others, t8, no doubt, which we have neither the intention nor the m,ns to situate here. In concerning ourselves with the fact that Plato h% not merely čĎd a simple element, we are thus bracketing off the problem of factual gen,logy and of the empirical, eIective communication among cultures and mythologies. 15 What we wish to do here is simply to 1int to the internal, structural necessity which alone h% made 1ssible such communication and any eventual contagion of mythemes. 15.

Plato, of course, das not deɱri' Theuth # a character. Not a single concrete cha^cteristic is attributed to him, neither in the Phaedఠ nor in the veè brief allusion in the Philebus. That is at le#t how things ap/ar. But in l]king more clolly, one comes to recognize that the situation he hcupies, the content of his speeches and o/^tions, and the relations among the themes, concepts, and signiYe in which his inte entions are engaged, all organize the fFtures of a strongly marked Ygure. The structur al analogy that relates these fetures to other gªs of writing, and mainly to the Egyptian Thoth, can ' the eXect neither of a partial or total Nɨowing, nor of chance or Plato's imagination. And in the simultaneous insertion, so rigoroo and closely Yt, of these t^its into the systematic arrangement of Plato's philosophemes, this meshing of the mythological and the philo sophical bints to some more deeply buried necessity.
No doubt the gª Thoth had seve^l faces, 'longed to seve^l er#, lived in lve^l homes. 16 The discordant tangle of mythological accounts in which he is caught should not ' neglected. Nevertheless, certain constants can ' distinguished throughout, d^wn in br§d letters with Yrm strokes.

What then, are the /rtinent t^its for someone who is tèing to reconstitute the structu^l resemblance 'twvn the Platonic and the other mythological Ygures of the origin of writing? The bringing out of these t^its should not merely se e to determine Fch of the signiYcations within the play of thematic opbsitions # they have been listed here, whether in Plato's discourse or in a gene^l conYguɢtion of mythologies. It must o/n onto the gene^l problematic of the relations 'twvn the mythemes and the philosophemes that lie at the origin of western logos. That is to say, of a histoè- or ^ther, of Histoè-which h# 'en prªuced in its entirety in the philosophiĢl diXerence 'tween mythos and logos, blindly sinking down into that diXerence # the natu^l obviooness of its own element. In the PÝ0xs, the gª of writing is thus a suNrdinate cha^cter, a second, a technh^t without bwer of decision, an engineer, a clever, ingenious se ant who h# 'en g^nted an audience with the king of the gªs. The king h# been kind enough to admit him to his counsel. Theuth presents a tekhniand aphaCkon to the king, father, and gª who s/aks or commands with his sun-Ylled voice.

İsn't he have the same place in Egyptian mythology? There tf, Thoth is an engendered gG. He often calls himself the son of the gG-king, the sun-gG, Ammon-Ra: "I am Thoth, the eldest son ofRa. " I ' Ra(the sun) is gG the crFtor, and he engenders through the mediation of the word. 18 His other name, the one by which he is in fact dwignated in the Phaedxs, is Ammon. The accepted sense of this pro/r name: the hidden. 19 Once again we encounter here a hidden sun, the father of all things, letting himllf ' represented by s/ech.
The conÝgurative unity of these signiÝcationsĀthe bwer of s/ech, the creation of 'ing and life, the sun (which is alÉ, # we shall e, the eye), the self-concealment-is conjugated in what could ' called the history of the egg or the egg of history. The world came out of an egg. More precisely, the living creator of the life of the world came out of an egg: the sun, then, w# at Ýt carried in an eggshell. Which explains a num'r of Ammon Ra's characteristics: he is also a bird, a Ƞcon ("I am the great falcon, hatched from his egg"). But in his capacity as origin of everything, Ammon-Ra is also the origin of the egg. He is desigäted sometimes # the bird-sun Ùrn from the primal egg, Émetimes # the originary bird, cØrier of the Ýrst egg. In this cľ, and since the bwer of s/ech is one with the power of crFtion, certain texts s/ak of "the egg of the great cackler." It would make no lnse here to #k the at once trivial and philosophical 17. Cf. S. Moret, P Religion òpti¹nt (Paris: Payo[, 1¿2), p. 58.

PLATO'S PHARMACY question of "the chicken or the egg," of the logical, chronological, or ontological priority of the cauP over the effect. This question h# been magniȤcently answered by cecain sarcophagi: "0 Ra, who art in thy egg." If we add that this egg is alÉ a "hidden egg, " ' we shall have constituted but also o/ned up the system of these signi<cations.
The suÙrdination of Thoth, the ibis, eldest son of the original bird, is marked in several ways: in the Memphitic dhtrine, for example, Thoth is the executor, through language, of Horus' creative project. 21 He bears the signs of the great sun-gG. He interprets him as a sbkesman, a standard ȇer. And like his Greek counterpart, Hermes, whom Plato moreover never mentions, he hcupiw the role of mesPnger-gG, of clever intermedi ary, ingenious and subtle enough to steal, and always to stFl away. The signiŌer-gG. Whatever he h# to enounce or inform in words h# alrFdy been thought by Horus. Language, of which he is debsitĽy and Pcretary, can thus only represent, so # to transmit the message, an already formed divine thought, a ȥxed design. 22 The message itself is not, but only represents, the absolutely crFtive moment. It is a second and secondary word. And when Thoth is concerned with the sbken rather than with the written word, which is rather seldom, he is never the absolute author or initiator of language. On the contrary, he intrGuces diÄerence into lan guage and it is to him that the origin of the plurality of languages is attributed. n (¿ter, we will #k, tuɦing back to Plato and to the Phi/ebϷ, whether diÄerentiation is rFlly a second step and whether this "Pcondar ity" is not the emergence of the grapheme # the very origin and bssibility 20. Cf. Morenz,. 232-33. The pćgAph that is abut to end here will have mĆkġ the ]ct that this pharmÇy of Plato's alx brings into play [mtÌaint) Bataille's text, icribing within the stoU of the egg the sun of the Çcu§d part [µ ʶn fTditt]; the whole of tÐt Īīy,  will quickly Ëcome ap²Únt, Ëing ithlf nothing buta ¡ding of FinnØam Wah. 2 1.

THE FILIAL INSCRIPTION of /ogoi itself. In the Philebm, Theuth is evoked indeed % the author of diIerence: of differentiation within langïge and not of the plurality of languages. But it is our lief that at their r8t the two problems are inseparable.)
As the g3 of langïge second and of linguistic diIerence, Thoth can become the g3 of the cr,tive word only by metonymic substitution, by historical displacement, and sometimes by violent subversion. This ty) of substitution thus puts Thoth in Ra'I p/a(e % the m8n takes the place of the sun. The g3 of writing thus supplies the place of Ra, supplementing him and supplanting him in his absence and essential disap)arance. Such is the origin of the m8n % supplement to the sun, of night light % supplement to daylight. And writing % the supplement of speech. "One day while Ra w% in the sky, he said: 'Bring  Thoth,' and Thoth w% straightway brought to him. The Majesty of this g3 said to Thoth: 'Be in the Ȋ in
 pԶe, while I Ihine ð t ± of the l଻ ஛giom... YoN aM in my p/a(e,
 MpԶ˸nt, and you will ēRO thm: Thoth, he who Mpl«˴ Ra.' Then all sorts of things sprang up thanks to the play of Ra's words. He said to Thoth: 'I wiR СIʆe you to bra(e ( ionh) t tï Iki˴ with your ˩uty and your raylٯnd thm t ઼on (ioh) W© . >ter, alluding to the fact that Thoth, % Ra's replacement, ¦cupies a somewhat subordinate position: 'I wiR СI«e you to Iend (hob) grTt) on˴ tÝn youneÖ and th౮ W©  t lbԝ ( hib), the bird of Thqth. "24
This pr¦ess of substitution, which thus functions % a pure play of traces or supplements or, again, o)rates within the order of the pure signi/er which no r,lity, no absolutely external reference, no transcendental sig niQed, can come to limit,?und, or control; this substitution, which could J judged "mad" since it can go on in/nitely in the element of the linguistic ȅrmutation of substitutes, of substitutes for substitutes; this unle%hed chain is nevertheless not lacking in violence. One would not have under sto3 anything of this "linguistic" "immanence". if one saw it % the Ȇaceful milieu of a merely /ctional war, an inoIensive word-play, in contr%t to some ragingpo/ôoJ in "reality. " It is not in any r,lity foreign to the "play of words" that Thoth also frequently pEticipates in plots, perQdious intrigues, conspiracies to usurp the throne. He helps the sons do away with the ºther, the brothers do away with the brother that h% Jcome king. Nout, curKd by Ra, no longer dis1Kd of a single date, a single day of the calendar on which she could give birth. Ra had bl¦ked from her all time, all the days and )ri3s there were for bringing a child into the world. Thoth, who also had a ȇwer of calculation over the institution of the 24. Erman, pp. 9+-9 1.

This supplementa¡ time enabled Nout to prGuce Åve children: Hararis, Ķth, Isis, Nephtys and Osiris, who would later 'come king in the place of his father Ĳb. During the reign of Osiris (the sun-king), Thoth, who w# also his brother, n "initiated men into arts and letters," and "crFted hiero glyphic writing to enable them to Åx their thoughts. "Z6 But later, he participates in the plot led by Seth, Osiris' jFlous brother. The famous legend of the dFth of Osiris  well known: tricked into 'ing shut up in a trunk the size of his bGy, he is dismem'red, and his fou«een parts are scattered to the winds. AŎer many complications, he is found and re#Pm bled by his wife Isis, all except for the phallus, which h# been swallowed by an ļyrhynchus ōsh.z' This das not prevent Thoth from acting with the cleverest and most oblivious opportunism. Isis, transformed into a vulture, lies on the corpP of Osiris. In that Bsition she engenders Horus, "the child-with-his-ōnger-in-his-mouth," who will attack his Xther's murder er. The latter, Ķth, tFrs out Horus' eye while Ho±s rips oY Seth's testicles. When Horus can get his eye back, he oYers it to his father-and this eye is also the mɓn: Thoth, if you will|d the eye brings Osiris back to life and potency.
In the courP of the Åght, Thoth Pparates the comȅtants and, in his role of gG-dhtor-pharmacist-magician, sews up their wounds and heŎs them of their mutilation. ¿ter, when the eye and testicles Øe back in place, a trial is held, during which Thoth turns on Seth whoP accomplice he had nevertheless once been, and conÅrms # true the words of Osiris.n As a substitute capable of doubling for the king, the father, the sun, and the word, distinguished from theP only by dint of reprePnting, re/ating, and m#querading, Thoth w# naturally also capable of totally supplanting them and appropriating all their attributes. He is added # the esPntial attribute of what he is added to, and from which almost nothing distin guishes him. He diYers from s/ech or divine light only # the revFler from the revFled. Barely.ń 25.

PLATO'S PHARMACY against the invention of the phaCöon is that it substitutes the br0thless sign for the living voice, claims to do without the father (who is Õth living and life-giving) of logß, and can no more aówer for itýlf than a sculpture or inanimate painting, etc. In all the cycles of Egyptian mythology, Thoth presides over the organiztion of death. The mter of writing, numArs, and calculation dõs not merely write down the weight of dead souls; he;rst counts out the days oflife, huŀat& history. His arithmetic thus covers the events of divine biography. He is "the one who meures the length of the lives of gns Ñd men. "n He behaves like a chief of funereal protmol, charged in pWticular with the dressing of the d0d.
Sometimes the d0d 5rson tÏes the place of the scriA. Within the space of such a scene, the d0d one's place (͟ p੖ Æ ાt; also = the dvmy, in bridge] then falls to Thoth. One can r0d on the pyramids the celestial histoI of one such soul: " 'Wğ Ĭ  going?' ks a gr0t bull thr0tening him with his horn" (we should note in psing that another name for Thoth, Ra's nmturnal representative, is the "bull among the stars"). " 'He's going fuR of vital he௖ to the ski&, to sࢩ his fath), to contӔlate Ra,' and the terriing cr0ture lets him ps. " (The Öoks of the d0d, placed in the cof;n next to the corpse, contained _ in particulW formul enabling him to "go out into the light of day" and նe the sun. The d0d 5rson must see the sun: d0th is the prerÜuisite, or even the ex5rience, of that face-to-ce encounter. One thinks of the PԂ.) Â the father welcomes him into his bark, and "it even hap5ns that he lets oß his own celestial scribe and puts the d0d man in hġ p`ce, so that he judg&, arbitrat&, and gi֫ Ϙs to one who is gçt) than hiʥe੪ "Ÿ The dead man can also simply A identi;ed with Thoth: "he is simply called a gn; he is Thoth, the stvng&t of the gଈ. "}7
The hieúrchical opsition Atween son and ther, subject and king, d0th and life, writing and s5ech, etc., naturally completes its system with that Atween night and day, West and Et, mn, and sun. Thoth, the "nmturnal representative of Ra, the bull among the stars,''{l turns toward the west. He is the gn of the mn, either  identi;ed with it or its protector. J9
The system of these traits brings into play an original kind of logic: the;gure of Thoth is opsed to its other (father, sun, life, s5ech, origin or 35. Mool, pp. 478. 36. Erin, p. 249. 3 7. Ibid. p. 250. u8. Ibid. p. 4 1. 39. Ùyl, pp. 62-75; VYdier, p. 65; Mopnz, p. 54; fA[ugie., p. 67.

By the same token, the /gure ofThoth takes sha) and takes its sha) from the very thing it resists and substitutes for. But it thereby oppoVs itseí, p%Vs into its other, and this messenger-g3 is truly a g3 of the abLlute ȃsage +tween opposites. If he had any identity-but he is precisely the g3 of non identity-he would  that coinȾ}ntʡ oppĮitϘum to which we will s8n have recourse again. In distinguishing himself from his op1site, Thoth also imitates it, +comes its sign and representative, obeys it and confoϩ to it, replaces it, by violence if nyd +. He is thus the ºther's other, the ºther, and the subversive movement of replacement. The g3 of writing is thus at once his ºther, his son, and himself. He cannot + %signed a ýed spot in the play of diàerences. Sly, slip)Å, and m%ked, an intriguer and a cFd, like Hermes, he is neither king nor jack, but rather a Lrt of jĪø, a Bçting signi/er, a wild cFd, one who puts play into play.
This g3 of resȶȗction is less interested in life or d,th than in d,th % a re)titiqn of life and life % a reh,Ȟl of d,th, in the awakening of life ¹d in the recommencement of d,th. This is wăt numþ, of which he is also the inventor and patron, mñ. Thoth re)ats everything in the addition of the supplement: in adding to and doubling % the sun, he is other than the sun ¹d the se % it; other than the g§ and the se, etc. Always taking a place not his own, a place one could call that of the d,d or the dȴmy, he h% neither a pro)r place nor a pro)r Ĥe. His propriety or pro)rty is impropriety or inappropriateness, the Bçting indetermination that allows for substitution and play. PĚy, of which he is also the inventor, % Plato himself reminds.

PLATO's PHARMACY word we put in quotation marks 'cause what it designates, to content ourselves with remaining within the closure of these op8sitions, is only a mMe of "submission" to the necessities of a given "language. " None of these concepts can translate the relation we  aiming at here. Then again, in other c"es, Plato can not see the links, can l0ve them in the shadow or break them up. And yet these links go on working of themselvȃ. In spite of him? thanks to him? in hÇ text? outiiౌ his text? but then where? between his text and the language? for w§t reader? at what moment? To answer such questions in principle and in general will sňm im8ssible; and that will give us the suspicion that there is some malformation in the question itself, in 0ch of its concepts, in 0ch of the opfitiob it thus accredits. One can always chse to 'lieve that if Plato did not put certain possibili ties of p"sage into practice, or even interSpted them, it is 'cause he?rceived them but leÑ them in the impracticable. This formulation is 8ssible only if one avoids all recourse to the diAerence 'tween conscious and unconscious, voluntaT and involuntary, a veT cSde tl for d0ling with relations in and to langqge. The same would ' true of the opposition 'tween speech-or writing|d language if that op8sition, " is oÑen the c"e, harked back to the above categories.
This re"on alone should already sufPce to prevent us from reconstituting the entire chain of signiPcations of the pÝCkon. No absolute privilege allows us absolutely to m"ter its textual system. This limitation can and should nevertheless ' displaced to a certain extent. The possibilities and 8wers of displacement are extremely diverse in nature, and, rather than enumerating here all their titles, let us attempt to prMuce me of their eAects " we go along, " we continue our mÎch through the Platonic problematic of writing.4}
We §ve just sketched out the corres8ndence 'peen the Pgure of Thoth in Egyptian mythology and a certain organi˒tion of concepts, philosophemes, metaphors, and mythemes picked up from what is called the Platonic text. The word pÝCkon h" seemed to us extremely apt for the t"k of tying all the thr0ds of this corres8ndence together. Let us now reread, in a rendering derived from Robin, this sentence from the PĎ஑: "Here, 0 King, says Theuth, is a discipline (>thÜ) that will make the Egyptians wiser (IophotӞui) and will improve their memories (mn̍onikOt)- 43.

THE PHARMAKON 97 o˃): `th memoT (mnȻŀ and instruction (sophȸ) have found their remedy ĭlXkon). "
The common translation of phaXkon by ɝy [ɜ˔-a 'nePcent dSg-is not, of cour«, inaccute. Not only cs plXkon ʕlly m0n ɛy and thus eʒe, on a certain surȒce of its ~nctioning, the ambiguity of its m0ning. But it is even quite obvious here, the stated intention of Theuth 'ing precisely to stress the worth of his prMuct, that he tuગ the word on its strange and invisible pivot, prenting it from a single one, the most re"s¬ing, of its polȄ. Tls medicine is 'nePcial; it repairs and prMuces, accumulates and remedies, incre"es knowledge and reduces forget~lness. Its translation by "remedy" nonetheless eʓs, in going outside the Greek language, the other 8le reseved in the wordphaXkon. It cancels out the resources of ambiguity and makes more diȔcult, if not impossible, an understanding of the context. As op8«d to "dSg" or even "medicine," ʖ says the transparent rationality of science, technique, and thera?utic causality, thus excluding from the text any l0ning toward the magic viues of a force whose eAects are hard to m"ter, a dyn^ics that constantly suʛrises the one who tries to manipulate it " m"ter and " subject.
Now, Ŗ t one lnd, Pla˸o is 'nt on presenting writing " an Wcult, and therefore susÚt, power. Just like painting, to which he will later compare it, and like optical illusions and the techniques of miબis in general. His mistrust of the mantic and magic, of rcerers and c"ters of s?lls, is well attested. Ħ In the ʄws, in particulÎ, he reseves them terrible punishments. According to an o?ration we wiii §ve cause to remem'r later, he recommends that they be excluded±x?lled or cut oA-from the sWial arena. Expulsion and ostcism can even ' accomplished at the s^e time, by keeping them in prison, where they would no longer ' visited by free men but only by the slave that would bring them their fb; then by depriving them of burial: "At d0th he shall ' c"t out 'yond the `rdeʜ without burial, and if any frÏ citizen h" a hand in his b¬ial, he shall ' liable to a prosecution for impiety at the suit of any who cares to take prWeedings" (X, 909Ҕ).
On t otȦ hand, the King's reply presupposes that the eAectiveness of the phaXkon can be reveÝed: it can worsen the ill inst0d of remedy it. Or rather, the royal answer suggests that Theuth, by ru« and/or naivete, h" exhibited the reverse of the true eAects of writing. In order to vaunt the 44.

R that in translatingplXkon by սy, what one respects is not what Theuth intended, nor even what Plato intended, but rather what the King ys Theuth h" said, eAectively deluding either the King or himself. If Plato's text then gis on to give the King's pronounce ment " the tSth of Theuth's prMuction and his s?ech " the tSth of writing, then the translation սy makes Theuth into a simpleton or a BimBam anist,Ȗ t sun's point of viȆ. From that viewpoint, Theuth h" no doubt played on the word, interÀpting, for his own pur8ses, the communication 'twÏn the two op8sing values. But the King restores that communication, and the traclation takes no account of this. And all the while the po interlWutors, whatever they do sd whether or not they chɯse, remain within the unity of the same signiPer. Their discourse plays within it, which is no longer the c"e in trsslation. Rࣄy is the rendition that, more than "medicine" or "dSg" would have done, obliterates the viual, dyn^ic references to the other ב of the s^e word in Greek. The eAect of such a translation is most im8antly to dȅtroy what we will later call Plato's anagrammatic writing, to destroy it by interÀpting the rela tions inteʢoven ^ong diAerent ~nctions of the ʧe word in diAerent places, relations that  virtʾlly but necessarily "citational." When a word inscribes itself " the citation of another sense of the same word, when the textql center-stage of the word phaXkon, even while it m0ns ஹy, cites, re-cites, and měes legible that which in t ղ w<d signiPes, in another spot and on a diAerent level of the stage, poison (for eˌmple, since that it not the only other thingplXkon m0ns), the choice of only oɣ of these renditions by the translator h" " its Prst eAect the neutralittion of the citational play, of the "sagram," Qd, in the end, quite simply of the veT textuality of the tʐslated text.

Textuality being consti tuted by diAerences and by diAerences from diAerences, it is by nature absolutely heterogeneous and is constantly comfing with the forces that tend to annihilate it.
One must therefore accept, follow, and analyze the com8sition of these two forces or of these two gestures. That composition is even, in a certain sense, the single theme of this essay. On the one hand Plato decides in favor

^ arr
THE PHARMAKON 99 of a logic that dis not tolerate such p"sages 'tween op8sing senses of the same word, all the more so since such a ege would rev0l itself to ' something quite diAerent from simple coɤsion, alternation, or the dialec tic of opposites. And yet, on the other hand, the phaCkon, if our r0ding conPrms itself, constitutes the original medium of that decision, the element that precedes it, comprehends it, g× 'yond it, can never ' reduced to itt and is not separated from it by a singlļ word (or signiÒing apparatus), o?rating within the Greek and Platonic text. All translations into languages that Îe the heirs and depositaries of Wtern metaphysics thus prMuce on the phaCkon an ΕfĶt of adlysis that violently destroys it, reduces it to one of its simple elements by interpreting it, paradoxically enough, in the light of the ulterior developments it itself aÛ made 8ssible. Such an interpretative trġlation is thus " violent " it is im8tent: it destroys the phaCkon but at the s^e time forbids itself access to it, leaving it untouched in its rĽseve.
The trQslation by "remedy" can thus ' neither accepted nor simply rejected. Even if one intended thereby to save the "rational" pole and the laudatoT intention, the id0 of the cଲଳ use of the sciBce or aã of medicine, one would still Àn eveT risk of being deceived by language. Writing is no more valuable, says Plato, " a remedy tȥ " a 8ison. Even 'fore Thamus h" let ll his?jorative sentence, the remedy is dist¬bing in itself. One must indeed ' aware of the ct that Plato is suspicious of the phaCkon in general, even in the cR of dÀgs exclusively for ther apeutic ends, even when they are wielded with gb intentions, and even when they are " such e¦ective. There is no such thing " a harmless remedy. The pÝCkon can never ' simply 'negcial.
For two diAerent re"ons, and at two diAerent depths. First of all because the 'nePcial essence or virtue of a pÝCkon d× not prevent it from hurting. The Pvtag<as cl"ses the phaCਜ਼ among the things than can ' both gb (agatha) and painful (aniara) (35ͥ). The phaCkon is always caught in the mixture (suષikton) mentioned in the Philebm ( 46a), exam ples of which are hubɟs, that violent, un`unded excess of plture that makes the proftigate cT out like a madman (45e), and "relieving an itch by rubbing, and anything that can ' tr0ted by such a remedy (ouk alੱ Mė phaCxeos)." This ty? of painZl ple"ure, linked " much to the malady " to its tr0tment, is aphaCkon in itself. It partakes of`th gb and ill, of the agreeable and the digre0ble. Or rather, it is within iʷ m"s that the_ op8sitions are able to sketch them_lves out.
Then again, more profoundly, even beyond the question of pain, the pharmaceutical remedy is essentially harm~l 'cau_ it is aigcial. In this,

PLATO's PHARMACY
Plato is following Greek tradition and, more precisely, the dWtors of Cos. Ăe phaCkon gis against natural life: not only life unaAected by any iilness, but even sick life, or ther the life of the sickness. For Plato 'lieves in the natural life and normal development, so to s?ak, of diste. In the Ti>em, natural diste, like log in the Pha0rm, is compared to a living organism which must be allowed to develop according to its own norms and forms, its sÚiPc rhythms and articulations. In dist˂bing the normal and natural progress of the illness, the phaCkon  thus the enemy of the living in general, whether healthy or sick. One must Ĩr this in mind, and Plato invites us to do so, when writing is proposed " a phaCkon. ContraT to life, writingÄr, if you will, the plCkoğĠan only di1p`ce or even ãraॕte the ill. Such will ', in its logical outlines, the objection the king raises to writing: under pretext of supplementing memoT, writing makes one even more forgetful; f from incrting knowledge, it diminishes it. Writing dis not answer the needs of memoT, it aims to the side, d× not reinforce the mn¦, but only Ípomn̈iJ. And if, in the two texts we are now going to lk at together, the formal structure of the argument is indeed the me; if in `th c"es what is sup8sed to prMuce the 8sitive and eliminate the negative dis nothing but dԐp`ce and at the s^e time ેltiply the eAects of the negative, l0ding the lack that w" its cause to proliferate, the necessity for this is inscribed in the Jign phaCkon, which Robin (for example) dismem'rs, here " remedy, there " dSg. We expressly said t\ Jign phaCkon, intending thereby to mark that what is in question is indԐJ଀iably a signiPer and a concept signiPed.
A) In the Ti>em, which spr0ds itself out, from its o?ning pages, in the space 'tween Egypt and Greece " in that 'tween writing and sɽɾh ("You Hellenes are never anything but children, and there is not an old ms ^ong you," where" in Egypt "everything h" been written down by us of old": snta gegramધ (22b, 2Ô]), Plato demonstrates that, among all the µy's movements, the 'st is natural motion, which spontaneously, from within, "is prMuced in a thing by itself":
Now of all motions that is the best which is prMuced in a thing by itself, for it is most akin to the motion of thought and of the universe, but that motion which is caused by others is not so gb, and worst of all is that which moves the bMy, when at rest, in pans only and by some agency alien to it. Wherefore of all mMes of puriÒing and reuniting the µy the best is gymn"tics; the next best is a surging motion, " in iling or any other mMe of conveyance which is not

Wherefore we ought always to manage them by regimen, " far " a man can spare the time, and not provoke a disagrȀble enemy by medicines УJhaCkदधonta) (89aٰ
The r0der will have noted that:
I. The noxiousness of the pÝCkon is indicted at the precise moment the entire context seems to authorize its translation by "remedy" rather than poison. 2. The natural illness of the living is degned in its essence " an aɐȂȟ, a reaction to the aggression of an alien element. And it is necessary that the most general concept of dise"e should be allergy, from the moment the natural life of the µy ought only to follow its own endogenous motions. 3. Just " h0lth is auto-nomous and auto-matic, "normal'' dise"e demonstrates its autarky by confronting the pharmaceutical aggression with Ftëtatic r0ctions which displace the site of the diste, with the eventual result that the points of resistance are reinforced and multiplied. "Normal" diste defends itself. In thus escaping the supplementary con straints, the su?radded pathogeny of the phaCkon, the diseR continues to follow its own course. 4. This schema implies that the living 'ing is gnite (and its malady " well): that it can have a relation with its other, then, in the allergic r0ction, that it h" a limited lifetime, that d0th is alr0dy inscribed and prYcribed within its structure, in irs "constitutive triangles." ("The triangles in us are originally framed with the 8wer ro l"t for a ceain time 'yond which no man can prolong his life. " Ibid.) The immortaliry and ɺrfection of a living ĥing would consist in irs having no relation at all with any outside. That is the c"e with GG (cf. Republic II, 38 lbٮc). Â h" no allergies.

PLATO's PHARMACY within. The phaCöon is that which, always springing up from without, acting like the outside itself, will never have any dePnable virtue of its own. But how can this supplementam ɸite ' excluded by maintaining the boundary, or, let us y, the triangle?
B) The system of these four features is reconstituted when, in the Pha0ఛ, King Thamus depresses and depreciates the p/Cöon of writing, a word t§t should thus not t h"tily ' considered a metaphor, unless the metaphorical 8ssibility is allowed to retain all its power of enigma. Perhaps we can now read the King's rY8nse:
But the king said, "Theuth, my m"ter of arts (O t˷hniöotale Thӥth), to one man it is given to cr0te the elements of an aʝ, to another to judge the extent of harm and use~lness it will have for tho_ who are going to employ it. And now, since you are father of written letters Ìalπ on gram>lon), your paternal gbwill h" led you to pronounce the vem op8site (loudntion) of what is their r0l power. The ct is that this invention will prMuce forgetfulness in the souls of those who have l0rned it 'cause they will not need to exercise their memories (lਗর Đ B piuc/ii pa௑ei mnԣi ame/et̊ia1), 'ing able to rely on what is written, using the stimulus of external marks that e alien to them_lves (d pԝtin graph̊ Τothen hup' aRotrion tupon) rather than, from within, their own unaided powers to call things to mind (ଽÓ B thB aulom huph' hauton admimn̊ৱoÞom). E it's not a remedy for memory, but for reminding, that you have discovered (ȍöoun mnԣi, aੰa hupomn̊e·, p/Cöon ήu௷). And " for wisdom (Ioph৥ }), you're equipping your pupils with only a semblance (ࡤn) of it, not with tSth (a/itn). āanks to you and your invention, yo¬ pupils will ' widely read without benePt of a t0cher's instÞction; in consequence, they'll entertain the delusion that they have wide knowledge, while they are, in fact, for the most drt incapable of ® judgment. They will also be difPcult to get on with since they will men Plled with the conceit of wisdom (ࡣoiophoi), not men of wisdom (anti IophOn)." (274e - 275b)
The king, the father of s?ech, h" thus "serted his authority over the father of writing. And he h" done so with severiʹ, without showing the one who Wcupies the place of his son any of that paternal gb will exhibited by Theuth toward his own children, his "letteÝ. " Th^us pres_s on, multiplies his reseʡations, and visibly wants to leave Theuth no ho?.

THE PHARMAKON 103
In order for writing to prMuce, " he says, the "opposite" effect from what one might ex?ct, in order for this phaXkon to show itself, with use, to ' injurious, its e}ectiveness, its power, its dudmii must, of course, ' ambiguous. As is said of the phaXkon in the PvÁg<Ø, the Phi/ebm, the TiՂm. It is precisely this ambiguity that Plato, through the mouth of the King, attempts to m"ter, to dominate by inserting its degnition into simple, clł-cut opʁitions: gb and evil, inside and outside, tSe and fal, esnce and apɼance. If one rer0ds the rtons adduced by the royal sentence, one will gnd this seriˠs of oppositions there. And set in place in such a way that the phaXkon, or, if you will, writing, can only go around in circles: writing is only appently gb for memory, s¸mingly able to help it from within, through its own motion, to know what is tSe. But in tSth, writing is essentially bad, external to memom, prMuctive not of science but of 'lief, not of tSth but of apÙces. The plXkon prMuces a play of apØrances which enable it to p"s for truth, etc. But while, in the Phi/ebm and the Pvtag<aÅ, theplXkon, becau it is pain¹l, seems bad whert it is 'negcial, here, in the PĎ௫ " in the Ti>em, it is esed o} " a help¹l remedy whert it is in tSth harm¹l. Bad ğbiguiʣ is thus opposed to gb Ğbiguity, a deceit¹l intention to a mere apÙce. Writing's c"e is grave.
It is not enough to say that writing is conceived out of this or t§t series of oppositions. Plato thinks of writing, Pd tries to comprehend it, to dominate it, on the b"is of oppoiition " such.

PLATO's PHARMACY can no longer ' distinguished, with the same "sunce, from tSth, r0lity, living Besh, etc. One must accept the fact that here, for once, to leave a ghost behind will in a sense be to salvage nothing.
This little exercise will no doubt have sufgced to warn the reader: to come to an understanding with Plato, " it is sketched our in this text, is already to slip away from the recognized mMels of commentam, from the genealogical or structural reconstitution of a system, whether this rŅon stitution tries to corro`te or reZte, congrm or "overturn," mark a return-to-Plato or give him a "send-oȓ in the quite Platonic manner of the khaiMin. What is going on here is something altogether di}erent. That t, o( course, but still completely other. If the reader h" any doubt, he is invited to rer0d the preceding paragraph. Every mMel of cl"sical r0ding is exceeded there at some point, precisely at the 8int where it attaches to the inside of the seriej-it 'ing understb that this excess is not a Iimple exit out of the series, since that would obviously fall under one of the categories of the ries. The excesj-but can we still call it that?-is only a cӢain displacement of the series. And a certain folding back [ʗÒwhich will later ' called a ʔ-ərɄ-of op8sition within the series, or even within its dialectic. We cannot qualiÒ it, name it, comprehend it under a simple concept without immediately being o} the mark. Such a ~nctional displacement, which concerns di}erences (and, " we shall see, "simulac `b more than -any-coɑceptʽf øùignigŁ, is a r0l and ´³ challenge. It writes itself. One must therefore 'gin by r0ding it. If writing, according to the king and under the sun, prMuces the opposite e}ect from what is exÚted, if the pÝC੃n is?rnicious, it is 'cause, like the one in the Ti>em, it disn't come from around here. It comes from ar, it is external or alien: to the living, which is the right-here of the inside, to /ogOI " the zԠn it claims to "sist or relieve. The imprints (tupoi) of writing do not inscri' themselves this time, " they do in t\ hypothesis of the Tখetei©, in the wģ of the soul in intaglio, thus corres8nding to the s8ntaneous, autWhthonous motions of psychic life. Knowing that he can always l0ve his thoughts outside or check them with an exteial agency, with the physical, spatial, su?rgcial marks that one lays ȕat on a tablet, he who h" the tekhniofwriting at his dis8sal will come to rely on it. He will know that he himself can l0ve without the tupoi's going away, that he can forget all a`ut them without their l0ving his sevice. They will represent him even if he forgets them; they will transmit his word even if he is not there to animate them. Even if he is d0d, and only a pÝCkon can ' the wielder of such 8wer, ǁ d0th but also in cahts

It would ' 'tter to "_ that the written t¿ces no longer even 'long to the order of the phuiii, since they are not alive. They do not grow; they grow no more than what could ' sown, " ´rates will say in a minute, with a reed (/aછI). They do violence to the natu¿l, autonomous organittion of the mn¦, in which phmii and piuchiare not opposed.

"Cryptogram" thus condenses in a single word a pleon"tic proposition.
If one takes the king's word for it, then, it is this life of the memory that the phaCkon of wʚting would come to hypnotize: f"cinating it, taking it out of itself by putting it to sleep in a monument.

PLATO'S PHARMACY
This is Plato's dePnition of the sophist. For it is above all agaiɦt sophistics that this diatribe against writing is directed: it can ' inscri'd within the interminable trial instituted by Plato, under the n^e of philosophy, against the sophists. The man who relies on writing, who brags a`ut the knowledge and powers it "sures him, thj!_simņ!!˳ Ąąked by Th^us h" all the features of a sophist: "the imitator of him who knows," " the SophÇt puts it (mi̛tæ lou Iophou, 2Ö c). He whom we would call the graphWrat is " much like the sophist Hippi" " a brother. Like the HippiĚwe· sŇ ln-ħh-e N Hippi, he bo"ts about knowing and doing all. And mainly-which ´rates twice, in two di}erent dialogues, ironically pretends he h" forgotten to include in his list-a`ut having a 'tter understanding than anyone else of mnemonics and mnemotechnics. This is indeed the power he considers his pride and joy:
SĔalΓ: Then in "tronomy also, the s^e man will ' true and false? Hippiai: It would seem so.
SĔatΓ: And now, Hippi", consider the question at lge a`ut all the sciences, and see whether the same principle dis not always hold. I know that in most arts you are the wisest (IophOtaloi) of men, " I have h0rd you `"ting in the Agora at the tables of the money-changers, when you were setting forth the gr0t and envi able stores of your wisdom.... Moreover, you told us that you had brought with you ʀms, epic, tragic, and dithyrambic, " well " prose writings of the most various kinds, and you said that your skill w" also pre-eminent in the aʞs which I w" just now mention ing, and in the true principles of rhythm and harmony and of orthogphy. And, if I remem'r rightly, there were a gr0t many other accomplishments in which you excelled. I have forgotten to mention your art of memom, which you regard " your s?cial glom, and I dare say that I have forgotten many other things, but, " I w" saying, only lk to your own arts-and there are plenty of them-and to those of others, and tell me, having regard to the admissions which you and I have made, whether you discover any depament of art or any description of wisdom or cunning, whichever name you use, in which the true and false are di}erent and not the lme. Tell me, if you can, of any. But you cannot. Hippiai: Not without conside¿tion, ´rates.

The sophist thus sells the sigb and insignia of science: not memoT itself (mn̍e}, only monuments (ɎpomnÜta), inventories, archives, citations, copies, accounts, tales, lists, notes, duplicates, chronicles, genealogies, references. Not memoT but memorials. He thus answers the demands of the w0lthy young men, and that is where he is most warmly applauded. After admitting that his young admirers cannot stand to hear him s?ak of the gr0ter part of his knowledge (G°t) Hippias, 285c-Ȁ, the sophist must tell Ārates all:
SĔat¥: What then are the subjects on which they listen to you with ple"ure sd applause? Pray enlighten me; I cannot ¤e.
Hipp২: They delight in the genealogies of heris and of men and in stories of the foundations of cities in olden times, and, to put it brieȘ y, in all forms of antiquarian lore, so that 'cause of them I have been com?lled to acquire a thorough comprehension and m"teT of all that branch of lŃing.
SĔat¥: Bless my soul, you have certainly been lucky that the úce daemonians do not want to h0r a recital of the list of our archons, from Solon downward; you would have had me trouble l0iing it.
Hipp̉s: Why? I can reØt Ðfty n^es after h0ring them once.
SĔat¥: I am rT, I quite forgot a`ut your mnemonic an.. (285d¥).
In tÞth, the sophist only pretends to know eveTthing; his "polymathy" (T SophÇt, 232a) is never anything but preten_. Insofar " writing ਫ਼ɂ a hand to hypomnesia and not to live memoT, it, t, is foreign to true ʨience, to anamnesia in its pro?rly psychic motion, to truth in the prWess of(its) prentation, to dialectics.

Hege!ī.Âl̅Ă At that sScipc Kint, the philßo୯θ, the ˹iit¦ are not ''oīerturned," "rejected," "reined in," etc., in the name of something like writing; quite the contü. But they are, according to a relation that philoÊphy would call ă_mN¹Æşaccording to a moï subtle excess of tÑth, )sumed and at the same time displaced into a completely different peld, where one can still, but that's all, "mime arlĩe ko¹Ţe," to use 1 expression coined by Bataille, whoÒ āame will enable us here to disSnse with a whole network of referenc.)
The front line that is violently inscri6d between Platonism and its cloÒst other, in the form of sophistics, is far from 6ing uniped, con tinuous, ) if stretched 6tween two homogeneous °. Its design is such that, through a systematic indecision, the parties and the party liÑs frequently exchange their resSctive places, imitating the forms and bor rowing the paths of the opKnent. TheÒ Srmutations are therefore possi ble, and if they are obliged to inscribe themselves within some common territory, the dissension no doubt remains internal and c)ts into absolute shadow some entirely-other of both sophistics and Platonism, some resist ance having no common denominator with this whole commutation. Contûy to what we have indicated rlier, there  also gÏ ro"or thinking that the diatri6 against writing is not aimed prst and foremost at the sophists. On the cont~ry: sometimes it sdms to pĄeed fϮ them. Isn't the stricture that one should exercise one's memoH rather than entÑst traces to an outside agency the imperious and cl)sical recommendation of the sophists? Plato would thus be appropriating here, once again, ) he so often d}s, one of the sophists' argumentations. And here again, he will ׌ it against them. And later on, after the royal judgment, vrates' whole discourse, which we will take apa¥ stitch by stitch, is woven out of schemes and concepts that issue from sophistics.
One must thus minutely recognize the crossing of the order. And 6 fully cogniènt that this rding of Plato is at no time spurred on by some slogan or p)sword of a "back-to-the-sophists" nature.
Thus, in oth c)es, on oth sides, writing is considered suspicious and the alert exercise of memory prescribed. What Plato is attacking in sophis tics, therefore, is not simply recourse to memory but, within such recoħe, the substitution of the mnemonic device for live memoH, of the prosthesjs for the organ; the SÉersion that consists of replacing a limb by-a -thl̆g. here, ·substituting the p)sive, mechanical "by-hrt" for the active reanimation of knowledge, for its repruction in the preÒnt. The ound aH (6tween inside and outside, living and nonliving) separates not only sSech from writing but also memory ) an unveiling (re-)prucing a

THE PHARMAKON 1 09 presence from re-memoration ) the mere re5tition of a monument; truth ) distinct from its sign, being ) distinct from ty5s. The "outside" d}s not 6gin at the qint where what we now call the psychic and the physical meet, but at the qint where the mn¦, instead of 6ing present to itself in its life ) a movement of truth, is supplanted by the archive, evicted by a sign of re-memoration or of com-memoration. The space of writing, space m writing, is o5ned up in the violent movement of this surrogation, in the di_erence 6tween mn̍i and hypomn̏is. The outside is already within the work of memoH. The evil slips in within the relation of memoH to itself, in the general organiètion of the mnesic activity. MemoH is Rnite by nature. Plato recognizes this in attributing life to it. As in the c)e of all living organisms, he )signs it, ) we have seen, certain limits. A limitless memory would in any event 6 not memory but inĦnite self-presence. MemoH always therefore already needs signs in order to recall the non present, with which it is necessarily in relation. The movement of dialectics 6ars witness to this. MemoH is th contaminated by its Rrst substitute: hypomn̏is. But what Plato drTʥ of is a memoH with no sign. That is, with no supplement. A mnĬwith no Ípomn̏is, noplbkon. And this at the very moment and for the very ron that he calls drTm the confion 6tween the hyqthetical and the Phyqthetical in the realm of mathema tical intelligibility (Republic, 533b).
Why' is the surrogate or supplement dangerous? It is not, ï to s5ak, dangerous in itself, in that )pect of it that can present itself ) a thing, ) a 6ing-present. In that c)e it would 6 rsuring. But here, the supple ment is not, is not a being (on). It is nevertheless not a simple non6ing (̛ on), either. Its slidings slip it out of the simple alternative presence/absence. That is the wxAnÀ¿Ý what enabiesªe " ĭl ways to pgs-for the originar.·· As-sán ·õ the supplementaH outside is o5ned, its structure implies that the supplement itself can be "ty5d," replaced by its double, and that a supplement to the supplement, a surrogate for the surrogate, is possible and necessaH. NecessaH 6cause this movement is not a sensible, "'empirical" accident: it is linked to the ideality of the eidos ) the qssibility of the re5tition of the same. And writing ap5ars to Plato (and aħer him to all of philosophy, which is ) such constituted in this gesture) ) that process of redoubling in which we are fatally (en)trained: the supplement of a supplement, the signiɞer, the representative of a representative. (A series whose Rrst term or rather whose Rrst structure d}s not yet-but we will do it later-have to 6 kicked up Vaire sautÛ) and its irreducibility made apparent.) The structure and history of phoՓtic writing have of course played a decisive role in the determination of writing ) the doubling of a

PLATO'S PHARMACY sign, the sign of a sign. The signiûer of a phonic signiûer. While the phonic signifier would remain in animate proĴmity, in the living presence of mn¦ or ps౔ԇ, the graphic signiûer, which repråuces it or imitates it, g}s one degree fuher away, ĥlls outside of life, entrains life out of itself and puts it to sldp in the ty5 of its double. Whence the p/èkon's two misdeeds: it dulls the memoH, and if it is of Py )sistance at all, it is not for the mn¦ but for ɎpomnæÇ. Instead of quickening life in the original, "in 5rson," the phaèkon can at best only restore its monuments. It is a debilitating Kison for memory, but a remedy or tonic for its external signs, its symptoɘ, with everything that this word can connote in Grdk: P empirical, contingent, su5rRcial event, geneúly a ĥll or collapse, dis tinguishing itself like an index from whatever it is Kinting to. Your writing cures only the symptom, the Ing  already said, and it is fĝm him that we know the unbridgable di_erence 6twdn the essence of lm symptom and the essence of the signiûed; Pd that writing 6longs to the order Pd exteriority of the symptom. ³us, even though writing is external to (internal) memo·, even though hyKmnia is not in itself memo·, it aÃects memory and hypnotizj it in its ve· inside. That is the e_ât of this phaèkon. If it were p§ely Üternal, writing would leave the intimacy or integrity of psychic memoH untouched. And yet, just ) Rousseau and Sauss§e will do in response to the same necessity, yet without diĔovering oth) relations 6tween the intimate Pd the alien, Plato maintains Õth the exteriority of writing aϓ its Kwer of mbeRcent 5netration, its ability to aÃect or infect what lies dd5st inside. The phaèkon is that dangero supplementš that brģs into the veH thing that would have liked to do without it yet lets itseä at ŗe be breached, roughed up, ÅlRlled, Pd replaced, completed by the veH trace t¥ough which the present incՅs itself in the act of di¥pëing. If, instead of meditating on the structure that makes such supplementar ity Kssible, if aove all instead of meditating on the reduction by which "Piato-Rousseau-Sauss§e" tH in vain to m)ter it with an åd kind of "roning," one were to content oneself with Kinting to the "logical contradiction," one would have to recognize here an iÇtance of that kind of 46. b. µe Épression '"that dangerof supplement,'" Ēd by Roïðu in his Cȭ/U Iiom to d°riJ muturÏti̩, is the title of that chapter in 0/ Gamftolȥ in which;`ida folloĘ the con÷Čnces of the way in which the word 1e]Ą/ɭt"s two m«nings in Fõnch - ''addition·· and ''õpl½ement" - complicate the logic [ Roïðu's tÄtment Ú ȃ, education, and writing.

In his attempt to arrange eveHthing in his favor, the defendant piles up contradictory arguments: 1. The kettle I ' returning to you is brand new; 2. The holes were already in it when you lent it to me; 3. You never lent me a kettle, anyway. Analogously: 1. Writing is rigorously exterior and inferior to living memoH and s5ech, which are therefore undamaged by it. 2. Writing is harmful to them because it puts them to sleep and infects their veH life which wo¹d othe¤ise remain intact. 3.

The opposition 6tween mn¦ and Ɏpomnæis would thus preside over the: meaning of writing. This opposition will ap5ar to us to form a system with all the great structural opKsitions of Platonism.

Neveæheless, 6teen mn¦ and Ɏpom૲is, 6teen memoH and its supplement, the line is more thP subtle; it is hardly 5rceptible. On oth sides of that line, it is a question of rɆetition. Live memory re5ats the presence of the ei s, and truth is als the possibility of re5tition through recall. Truth unveils the ei࡝s or the ont਌s on, in other words, that which can 6 imitated, repruced, re5ated in "its identity. But in the anamnesic movement of tñth, what is re5ated must present itself ) such, ) what it is, in re5tition. The tñe is re5ated; it is what is re5ated in the re5tition, what is represented and present in the reprjentation. It is not the re5ater in the re5tition, nor the signiÄer in the signiÄcation. ³e true is the presence of the eiĝ signiÄed.
Sophistics-the deployment of hyKmnesif well ) dialecticđthe deployment of aåmnesia-oth presupKse the Kssibility of re5tition. But sophistics this time keeps to the other side, to the other face, ) it were, of re5tition. And of signiÄcation. What is re ted is the re5ater, the imitator, the signiÄer, the representative, in the absence, ) it hap5ns, of the thing itseí, which these ap5ar to reedit, and without psychic or mnesic animation, without the living tension of dialectics. Writing would inddd 6 the signiÄer's capacity to re5at itself by itself, mechanically, without a living soul to sustain or attend it in its re5tition, that is to say, without truth's pr¥enting itseí anywhere.

Writing is considered a consolation, a com5nsation, a remedy for sickly s5ech.

It is oæy within this ambivalence Pd this mysterious indetermination of logos, and after these have 6en râognized, that Gorgi) Atʕin¥ truth ) a wİld, a structure or order, the counterpart (kosËs) of logos.

But Âfore such a determination, we Ôe in the ambivalent, indeterminate space of the p¤bkon, of that which in logos remains potency, potentiality, and is not yet the transparent langge of knowledge. If one were justiRed in tHing to capture it in categories that  subsequent to and de5ndent uqn the histoH thus o5ned up, categories arising precisely in the aʚ࣭th of vision, one would have to speak of the "irrationality" of living logo, of its s5llbinding qwers of enchantment, mesmerizing f)cination, and alchemical transformation, which make it kin to witchcraft and magic.

PLATO'S PHARMACY prevents the conclusion that Helen similarly, against her will, might have come under the in¢uence (humnÎ) of slech, jt ) if ravished by the force of the mighty?... For s5ech constrained the soul, lrsuading it which it lrsded, th to 6lieve the things said and to approve the things done. The lrsder, like a constrainer, d}s the wrong and the lrsuaded, like the constrained, in speech is wrongly chÁged.:º̍
PersuĠive elãuence Ìeith਎ is the Kwer to brģ in, to carH o_, to seduce internally, to ravish invisibly. It is Å¥ive force 5r se. But in showing that Helen gave in to the violence of slech (would she have yielded to a letter?), in disculķating this victim, Gorgi) indicts logos in its capacity to lie. "By intrucing some roning (logԨmon) into slech (toi logoi)," he wishes "to frd the accused of blame and, having reproved her detractors ) prevaricators and proved the truth, to frd her from their ignorance. "
But 6fore 6ing reined in and tamed by the kosmÎ and order of tÑth, logos is a wild creature, an ambiguous animality. Its magical "phar maceutical" force derives from this ambivalence, which explains the dis proK¥ion 6twdn the strength of that force and the inconside~ble thing slech seems to 6:

But if this is the c)e, Pd ī logÎ is already a lnetrating supplement, then isn't vrates, "he who d}s not write," also a m)ter of the p¬ȓkon? And in that way isn't he the spitting image of a sophist? a p¬ȓkठ? a magician? a sorcerer? ɗen a poiėner? and even one of those imístoÐ denounced by Gorgi)? The threads of these complicities are almost im possible to disentangle. vrates in the dialoguj of Plato oɡen h) the ãce of a p¬ȓkeD. ³at is the n«e given by Diotima to Eros. But behind the í¥rait of Eros, one cannot fail to recognize the features of vrates, as though Diotima, in lįking at him, were proposing to vrates the po¥rait of vratj (Sympo sium, 203c,d,e). Eros, who is neither rich, nor?autiÅl, nor delicate, s5nds his life philosophizing Ìhilosophon dia pantos lou biou); he is a fearsome sorcerer (ĤinÎ gՠ), magiciP Ì¬ȓkeD), and sophist (sophistæ). A being that no "logic" can conRne within a noncontradictory deɟnition, an individl of the demonic species, neither g nor man, neither immor tal nor mortal, neither living nor dead, he forms "the medium of the prophetic arts, of the priestly rites of sacrifice, initiation, and incantation, of divination and of sorceH (thusib-teleʶs-ep´s-änteian)" (202e). In that same dialogue, Agathon accuses Sarates of tHing to?witch him, to c)t a spell over him (P¬Cttein boulei me, o Sokrat¥, 19ͥ). The ï¥rait of Eros by Diotima is placed?twdn this exclamation and the portÈit of SaÈtes by Alcibiades.

On the condition, in a word, that he consent to die. The death of the  y, at lÚt: that is the price that must 6 paid for alitheia and the episteme, which are also powers. '
The fear of death is what gives all witchcraft, all acult medicine, a hold. The p¬əkeʆ is banking on that fear. Hence the ratic pharmacy, in working to free ù from it, corresqnds to an âration of ex<ࠂsm, in a form that could 6 envisaged and conducted from the side and viewqint of u. After wondering whether some Ê had given men a drug to induce fear ōhobou phaəkon), the Athenian of the ¢ws dismisses the idea: "Jt's reSat the qint we were ming to the legislator: 'Agreed then: there is probably no such thing \ a drug ōhaૌkon) to pruce fear, either by gift or human contrivance (I leave quacks ХĖtas) out of account: they're beyond the pale).

(Phaedo, 77e). In the Crito, tx, rates reÅses to give in to the Sople who "conjure up fresh hordes of ogeys to terrify our childish minds, by subjecting us to chains and executions and conRscations of our property" (4Ѥ).
The countersSll, the exorcism, the antidote, is dialectics. In answer to Ce?s, Sarates recommends sdking not only a magician but alsÛ-the surest incantation-training in dialectics: "Seek for him among all Soples, far and wide, sparing neither pains nor money; for there is no?tter way of sSnding your money. And you must seek «ong yourselves, tx; for you will not find others?tter suited for the t)k" (Phaࢤ, 7@).
To sdk "«ong yourselves" by mutual questioning and self examination, to seek to know oneself through the detour of the lPguage of the other, such is the underting presented by ùtes, who recalls the Delphic inscription (lou Delphikou gramätos), to Alcibiades ) the antidote (a/¡iphaȓkon), the counteątion. In the text of the ¢ws which we left o_ quoting Ùlier, when the necessity of the letter h)?en Rrmly laid down, the introjection or internaliètion of the gramäla into the judge's soul-their most secure dwelling-placɄ-is then prescri?d ) an antidote. Let us pick up the thread of the text again:
He that would show himself a righteously equal judge must kdp these matters?fore his eyes; he must praure ¥oY on the subject, and must me them his study. There is, in truth, no study whatsnv er 	 potent ) this of law, if the law? what it should?, to make a?tter man of its studentŇlse 'twould 6 for nothing that the law which so stirs our worship and wonder bears a name so cognate with that of understanding [nomÎlnoİ}. Furthermore, consider all other discourse, îsy with its eulogies and its satires, or utterances in prose, whether in literature or in the common converse of daily life, with their contentious disagreements and their tx often unmeaning admissions. The one ceain touchstone of all is the writings of the legislator (Ia lou nomotদou gramäla). T goʩ judge wiR poss¥s those ೋitings wi1hin his Ƶm soul (ha Ai kektԢBon en ¬utoi) N anti t¥ (a/¡iphaȓ) against oth˺ discourse, and thus he will? the state's preseĊer ) well ) his own.

PLATO's PHARMACY vicious principles admit remedy, will promote, so far ) he can, conve¢ion from folly, from pro¢igacy, from cowardice, in a word, from all forms of wrong. As for those who are fatally attached to such principles, if our judges and their su5riors prescribe death ) a cure (ä) for a soul in that state, they will, ) h)?en more than once said alre`y, djeÉe the praise of the community for their conduct (XII, 957c-95?; emph)is mine).
Anenesic dialectics, ) the re5tition of the eiĝ, cannot? distin guished from self-knowledge and Òlf-m)tery. Those are the Âst forms of exorcism that cP? applied against the terr¢ of the child faced with death and the quacke· of the bogeyman. Philosophy consists of o_ering rĤsur ance to children. That is, if one prefers, of taking them out of childhÏ, of forgetting aut the child, or, inversely, but by the s«e token, of sìing Rrst and foremost/İ that little y within us, of teaching him to sì-to dialoguɅ-by displacing his fear or his desire.
One could play at cl)siýing, within the weave of the SϴtĶän (28ɹ ु, that sScies of protection (aĔĕ1n1Λion) that is called dialectics and apprehended ) a counter-qison. Among the things that can? called aæipcial (mPufactured or acquired), the Stranger distinguishes those with the Ĩnction of doing something (tending toward poiein) and those, called defenses (amԿnlπia), with the function of preventing suffering (lo੸. ਱khein). Among the larter, one can distinguish ( l) anti tĶ (a/exiphaɈɉ ), which can? either human or divine (and dialectics is from this 5rsSctive the ve· antidoteness of the antidote in general, before any qssibility of dividing it up?twdn the human and the divine. Dialectics is precisely the passage?tween the two) and (2) p௻l࣊ ͉obiÜÁ): what stands before onɋɌbstacles, shelte¢, armor, shields, defenses.

This ͗ would thus rule out, if one follows the divisions literally, all recourse to Ptidotes, and consequently, to that s5cies of antidote or inverted phaɈɉ kon constituted by dialectics. The text excludes dialectics. And yet, it will nevertheless be necessa· later to distinguish?tween two sorts of texture, if one?ars in mind that dialectics is also an a¥ of weaving, a science of the s±mploki.

The inverted phaȓ kon, which scatters all the hobgoblins, is none other than the origin of the epist̎, the oSning to truth \ the Kssibility of reStition and the submission of that "greed for life" (epithuFin zĒ, Crito, 53e) to law (the gÏ, the ãther, the king, the chief, the capital, the sun, all of which are invisible). It is the laws themselves that, in the Crito, urge one not to "cling Ê greedily to life, at the price of violating the mıt stringent laws." What inddd d}s vrates say when Ceġ and Simmi\ \k him to prvide t̉em with a magician? He urges them to practice the philosophic dialogue and sdk its most wohy object: the truth of the eiĝ \ that which is identical to itself, always the óe \ itself and therefore simple, incom Ksite (asuntheton), undecomposable, invÁiable (78c,e). The ei s is that which can always 6 related \ the saF. The ideality and invisibility of the eiҷs are its Kwer-to-6-re ted. Now, law is always a law of reltition, and reltition is always submission to a law. In the lrsoniRcation of the ĝws in the Cito, vrates is called uKn to accept oth death and law at once. He is \ked to recognize himself \ the o_spring, the son or representa tive (ekgonÎ) or even the slave ( ulÎ) of the law that, in uniting his father and mother, made Kssible his birth. Violence is thus eĬn more ¥crile gious when it oɜends the law of the mother/countH than when it wounds the father and mother (5 lc). This is why, say the ĝws, vrates must die in conformity with the law and within the conRnj of the city-vrates, who w\ (almost) always reluctant to go outside:
Are you so wise \ to have forgotten that compared with your mother and father and all the ïst of your ancestors your countH is something far more precious, more venerable, more sacred, and held in greater honor th among gås and ÷ong all ronable men?... Violence is a sin even against your countH.... SÞrates, we have substantial evidence that you are satisRed with us and with the state Ìolis).

The Sa~tic word d}s not wander, stays at home, is closely watched: within autahthony, within the city, within the law, under the suÉeillance of its mother tongue. This will take on its full signiRcance further on, when writing will? djcri?d ) errancy ) such, mute vulnerability to all aggression. In nothing d}s writing reside.
The eiĝ, truth, law, the epist̎, dialectics, philosophy-all these are other names for that phaÃkon that mt? opKsed to the phaÃkon of the Sophists and to the?witching fear of death. It is p¬ÃkeD against phaÃkeD, p¬Ãkon against phaÃkon. This is why ratj heeds the ĝws ) though, through their voices, he were under the Kwer of an initiatic s5ll, a sonorous s5ll, then, or rather, a phonic s5ll, one that 5netrates and cÓries away the inner courts of the Êul. "That, my dear friena Crito, I do )sure you, is what I seem to hear them saying, just ) a CoHbant seems to hear the strains of music, and the sound of their arguments (ή ikhi touton ton logon) rings so loudly in my head that I cannot hr the other side" (54ҍ. Those CoHbants, that music, are evoked by Alcibiades in the Symposium in his e_orts to ·djcri? the e_ects of the ratic utte~nce: "the moment I hɑ him s k I ÷ smitten with a kind of sacred rage, worse than any CoHbant, and my heart jumps into my mouth" (2 15e).
The philosophical, epistemic order of logos ) an antidote, ) a force i´iô within the gB˺al alogi݌al ࢗnoù of the phaÃkon is not something we are proKsing here ) a daring interpretation of Platonism. Let us, rather, lxk at the prayer that o5ns the Critias: "I call on the g to g~nt us that most e_ective medicine ō¬Ãkon teleotaton), that ġt of all medicines (ariston phaÃkon): knowledge (ࣛistਜ)." And one could alÊ consider the )tonishing dr÷atic staging of the RÐt act of the Chaņi~. It should? followed moment by moment. Gzzled by the?auty of Char m ides, rates wants aove all to undress the so¹ of this young mP who loves philosophy. Charm ides is sent for so that he can? presented to a dator (Sarates) who can relieve him of his headaches and his wɐnjs. rates accepts to p)s himself o_ ) a man who knows a cure for headachj. There then ensues a "cloak" scene similar to the one in the P¬ӆ௩, involving a certain phaÃkon:
When Criti) told him that I w) the 5Ðon who had the cure (ho to phaÃkon epistaÞos), he lxked at me in an indescribable manner, and made ) though to )k me a question. And all the 5ople in the

PLATO'S PHARMACY 1 25 palaestra crowded about ׈, and at that moment, my goß friend, I glanced through the o5ning of his garment, and w) inɠamed by his 6auty. Then I could no longer contain myself.... But still when he )ked me if I knew the cure for the headÍhe (to tɒ kephalɒ p¬Ckon)... I replied that it w) a kind of leaf, which required to 6 accompanied by a charm (epµ A tis epi toi phaCkot), and if a 5rson would re5at the charm at the ēe time that he used the cure, he would be made whole, but that without the charm the leaf would Â of no avail. -Then I will write out the charm from your dictation, he said (155d - 15˙. Cf. also 175 - 176).''
But the head cannot Â cured separately. Gįd dators take care of "the whole," and it is by caring for the whole that they have Âen inspired by a Thracian physician, ''one of the physicians of the Thracian king Vlmoxis who are said to Â able even to give immoality," rates shows that the whole of the  y can only be cured at the sourcɇ-the soul-of all its gįds and evils. "And the cure of the soul, my dr youth, h) to 6 e_ected by the use of certain charms (epਐis tৠin), and these charms are fair words, and by them tem5rance (sophrÎunin) is implanted in the soul, and where tem5r cce comes and stays, there health is s5edily impaed, not only to the hd, but to the whole  y" (157a). And the discussion turns to the essence of tem5rance, the ġt p¬Ckon, the capital cure.
Philosophy thus opposes to its other this tÈÇmutation of the dćg into a remedy, of the poison into a counterKison. Such an o5ration would not 6 ðssible if the phaCko-logos did not alþdy haror within itself that complicity of contraH values, and if the phaCkon in general were not, prior to any distinction -ming, that which, presenting itself ) a poison, may turn out to 6 a cure, may retrı5ctively reveal itself in the tòth of its curative power. The "essence" of the phaCkon lies in the way in which, having no stable essence, no "proper" characteristics, it is not, in any sense ؁ ؂. The r@der will have;ted t¾t this e¤ mÒ a stGnge, invet aC symmetrical ĉndant to the one in the P:td%J. It is inveued in that the unit which, under the cloak, allowed a text and a p:m1Ron to (e)merge is TrimCiB in the P:t4J (the p:mGR' is the text already written by ''the ablt writer of our day"), and only SuCiB in the C:ai5!the prcription for the p:bkon eGtes recommeCs m>t Õ taken down under his dictation). ge eGtic preription here is oGl, and sĐech accompani the p:ckon  the condition of irs e¯ectiveness.

The phaCöon h\ no ideal identity; it is ğeidetic, RÐtly Ƅę it is not mon}idetic (in the sense in which the PԂ s5aks of the eiĝ \ something simple, noncomposite: monłi~). This "medicine" is not a simple thing. But neither is it a composite, a sensible or empirical suntheton paæaking of several simple essences. It is rather the prior medium in which di_erentiation in general is pruced, along with the opKsition between the eiĝ and its other; this medium is adlogoD to the one that will, subsequent to and according to the decision of philosophy, 6 reseÉed for tÈnscendental imagination, that "͖ hidden in the depths of the soul," which 6longs neither simply to the sensible nor simply to the intelligible, neither simply to èsivity nor simply to Ítivity. ³e element-medium will always 6 analogous to a mixed-medi÷. In a certain way, Plato thought aut and even formulated this ambivalence. But he did s in p)sing, incideÔally, discrdtly: in connection with the union of opKsit within vi¥ue, not the union of virtue with its opKsite:
Strang): But in those of noble nature from their rlie̊t days whose nu£ure tx h\ Öen all it should 6, the laws can foster the growth of this common nd of conviction and only in these. ³is is the talisman (p¬Cöon) apKinted for them by the design of pĥ intelligence.

This pharmaceutical nonsubstance cğnot 6 handled with complete security, neither in its 6ing, since it h\ none, nor in its e_ects, the sense of which is always capable of changing. In this way, writing, touted by ³euth \ a remedy, a 6nepcial drug, is later ove£urned ğd denounced by the king and then, in the king's place, by vrates, \ a hÁmÅl substance, a philter of forgetÅlness.

Not only by rhe polarity gb/evil, bur by rhe double parriciparion in the distinct regioɧ of the soul and the Ty, the invisible and rhe visible. This double participa tion, once again, dis not mix together two previously separate elements; it refers back to a saF that is not the identical, to the common element or medium of any possible dissWiation. Thus, writing is giૅ " the sensible, visible, spatial surrogare of the mn̎; ir larer rurns out ro ' harm~l and 'numbing to the invisible interior of the nul, memoʤ and tSth.

It is on the b"is o( this play or movement that the opposit or diAerenc  stop?d by\ Plato. The pɋCkon is the movement, the lWus, sd the play: (the prMuction of) diAerence. It is the di¦eʑce of di¦erence. It holds in reseve, in its undecided shadow and vigil, the opposit sd the diAerends that the prWess of discrimination will come to cave out. Contradictions and pairs of opposites are liÑed from the `ttom of this diacritical, di¦ering, deferring, reseve. Already inhabited by di¦erance, this ʘve, even though it "precedes" the opposition ħtween diAerent eAects, even rhough it pr¸xists diAerences " eAects, dis not have the puncʸ simplicity of a coinȾ࡙tia opposit<um.

It is pÁt of the Ĉles of this game that the g«e sho¹d sࢬ to stop. Then the pɋɈɉkon, which is older than either of the opòites, is "caught" by philosophy, by "Platonism" which is constitutɒ by this appreheÇion, ) a mixture of two pure, heterogeneo terms. And one could follow the word pɋɈɉkon ) a guiding thread within the whole Platonic problematic of the mixture. Apprehended ) a blɔd and an impøity, the phaɈɉkon also acts like an aggressor or a housebrģer, threatening some inteăal purity àd security. This definition is absolutely general and cP 6 veriRed even in c)es where such forced entrij  valorized: the gÏ remedy, ratic irony, comes to disturb the intestinal organization of self-complacency. The pøity of the inside can then only 6 restored if the charg& aM brought ĝ against exteriority ) a supplement, inessential yet harmf¹ to the essence, a surplus that ought never to have come to 6 added to the untouched plenitude of the inside. The restoration of internal purity mt th râonstitute, ÿtɉ-and this is myth ) such, the ùtholoӿ for eúmple of a logos recounting its origin, going back to the eve of the pharma kographic aggrjsioÏ-that to which the pঌ঍kon should not have had to 6 added and attached like a lit)al parĩite: a lett) iÇtalling itself inside a living organism to rob it of its nouishόt and to dist<t [like static, = "đit parĩite"} the pure audibility of a voice. Such are the relations 6tween the writing supplement and the logÎ-zԠn. In order to cure the latter of the phaɈɉkon and rid it of the par)ite, it is thus necessary to put the outside back in its place. To keep the outside out. This is the inaugural gesture of "logic" itself, of gxd "sense" insoãr ) it accords with the self-identity of tɋt which is: being is what it is, the outside is outside Ɂ the inside inside.

Plato dys not make a show of the chain of signi;cations we are tTing progressively to dig up. If there were ¿y ense in asking such a question, which we don't,lieve, it would, imKssible to say to what extent he manipÀates it voluntarily or consciously, and at what Kint he is subject to constraints weighing uKn his discoÒse from "language. " The word "lan gge," through all that binds it to eveTthing we Xe putting in question here, is not of any 3rtinent assistance, and to follow the constraints of a language would not exclude the Kssibility that Plato is playing with them, even if his game is neither reprentative nor voluntaT. It is in the back rSm, in the shadows of the pharmacy, prior to the opKsitions,½een conscious and unconscioÓ, freedom and constraint, voluntaT and involun taT, s3ech and langge, that thee textual "operations" 9cur. Plato seems to place no emph`is on the word phaèkon at the Kint whe¥ writing's e~ects swe¯e from Ksitive to negative, when Kison, under the eyes of the king, appears as the truth of the remedy. It is not said that the phaèkon is the l9us, the supKP, and the executor of this mutation. Vter-we will come to thi³-while expressly comparing writ ing to painting, Plato will not explicitly put this judgment together with the fact that elsewhere he refe« to painting as aphaèkon. For in Greek, p/èkon also means paint, not a natural color but an aPi;cial tint, a chemical dye that imitates the chromatic scale given in nature. Yet all these signi;cations nonetheless apËr, and, more precisely, all these words apËr in the text of"Plato. " Only the chain is concZled, and, to an inappreciable extent, concealed from the author himself, if ¿y such thing exists. One can say in any event that all the "pharmaceutical" words we have,en Kinting out do actlly make an "act of prznce," so to s3ak, in the text of the dialogues. Curiously, however, there is another of these words that, to our knowledge, is never Óed by Plato. If we line it up with the series phaèke-phaèkon-phaèkeD, we will no longer, able to content ourselves with reconstituting a chain that, for all its hiddenness, for all it might esca3 Plato's notice, is nevePheless something that passes through cePain discoverable points of pr&hce that can be seen in the text. The word to which we are now going to refer, which is prent in the lang¿e and which Kints to an experience that was present in Greek culture even in Plato's day, seems strikingly absent from the "Platonic text. "
But what dys absent or p̫ent mZn here? Like any text, the text of "Plato" couldn't not, involved, at least in a virtual, dyntic, lateral manner, with all the words that composed the system of the Greek language. Certain forces of association unitt-at diverse distances, with

PLATO'S PHARMACY different strengths and according to dis¨rate pathÎÏhe words "actïlly present" in a discourse with all the other words in the lexical system, whether or not they ap¶r $ "words," that is, $ relative verbal units in such discouÈe. They communicate with the totality of the lexicon through their syntactic play and at le$t through the subunits that comâe what we call a word. For ex@ple, "pharmakon"  already in communication with all the words from the same f@ily, with all the significations constécted out of the sze rIt, and these communications do not stop there. The textual chain we mVt set back in place is thus no longer simply "internal" to Plato's lexicon. But in going )yond the munds of that lexicon, we  lev interested in breying through ceLain limits, with or without caVe, than in putting in doubt the right to 4sit such limits in the prst place. In a word, we do not )lieve that there exists, in all rigor, a Platonic text, dosed u4n itself, complete with its inside and ib outside. Not that one must then consider that it is lŠing on all sides <d c< ) drowned conRsedly in the undiAerentiated generality of its element. Rather, provided the |ic ulations are rigorously and prudently recognized, one should simply ) able to untangle the hidden forces of attraction linking a present word with an abnt word in the text of Plato. Pme such force, given the systȁ of the langïge, cannot not have acted u4n the writing and the reading of this text. With res8ct to the weight of such a force, the so-called "presence" of a quite relative verŘl unit-the woä-while not )ing a contingent accident woLhy of no attention, neveLhelev ds not constitute the ultimate criterion and the utmost 8rtinence.
The circuit we are pro4sing is, moreover, all the more legitimate and y since it l9ds to a woä that can, on one of iȹ faces, ) considered the synonym, almost the homonym, of a word Plato "actually" usţ. The word in question is pÕæk§ (wiÝrd, magici<, 4isoner), a synonym of pÕ6 ÜkeÚ (which Plato uses), but with the unique feature of having )en overdetermined, overlaid by Greek culture with another Rnction. Another vle, and a formidable one.
The character of the phaæk§ h$ )en compared to a sca8goat. The ऒil and the outsiӐ, the expulsion of the evil, its exclusion out of the Êy (and out) of the city-these are the o major senses of the character <d of the ritual.

THE PHARMAKOS
Tzetzes gives the following account, Éed on certain fragments by the satirical ¼t Hip4n}, of the ceremony: "The (rite of the) phaèkos ` a puri=cation of this soL of old. If a calamity oveLIk the city by the wrath of u, whether it were f@ine or pestilence or any other mischief, they led foLh $ though to a sacri=ce the most unsightly of them all $ a puripcation and a remedy to the suAering city. They set the sacripce in the ap4inted place, and gave him ch¡se with their hands and a barley cake and =gs, and seven times they smote him with leeks and wild =gs and other wild plants. Finally they burnt him with fire with the wS of wild tre[ and scattered the $hes into the s and to the winds, for a puri=cation, $ I said, of the sØfering city."
The city's Êy pÆº thus reconstitut[ its unity, clos around the security of its inner couLs, gives back to itself the word that links it with itself within the con=nes of the agora, by violently excluding from its territory the representative of an external thrt or aggfssion. That repre sentative represents the otherness of the evil that comes to aAect or infect the inside by unpredictably breaking into it. Yet the representative of the outside A nonethelev comtitut0, regularly granted its place by the com munity, chosen, kept, ūd, etc., in the ve; heaL of the inside. These par$ites were $ a matter of course domesticated by the living organism that housed them at its ex8nse. "The Atheni<s regularly maintained a num)r of degraded and useless )ings at the public ex8nse; and when any cal@ity, such $ plague, drought, or famine, )fell the city, they sacripced two of these outc$ts $ scapeg±ts. "ý
The ceremony of the phaèkÎ is thus played out on the boundary line )tween inside <d outside, which it h$ $ its Rnction celevly to trace and ftrace. Intra muĘslextra muros.

These exclusions tIk place at critical moments (drought, plague, famine). De·sion w$ then repeated. But the m$te; of the critical instance requires 'that surprise ) prepared for: by rules, by law, by the regularity of re8tition, by =xing the date.

And up through the Tfth centu;. Aristophanes and Lysi$ clearly allude to it. Plato could not have )en unaware of it.
The date of the ceremony is notewoLhy: the sixth day of the Thargelia. That w$ the day of the biLh of him whose d9tŮůnd not only becaVe a p/Ckon w$ its direct ca׍-resembles that of a p/Ckß from the inside: Grates.
Grates, aAectionately called the phaCkeus in the dialogues of Plato; Grates, who faced with the complaint.rapŰ} l>ged against him, refused to defend himself, declined the logographic offer of Lysi$, "the abl[t writer of our time," who had pro4sed to ghost-write a defense for him; Grates w$ born on the sixth day of the Thargelia. Diogenes mertius testiTes to this: "He w$ born on the sixth day ofThargelion, the day when the Athenians puriÓ the city. " 7. The Ingredients:
PhantBms, Festivals, and Paints
The rite of the p/Ckß: evil and death, repetition and exclusion. Grates ties up into a system all the counts of indictment against the p/Ckon of writing at the 4int at which he adopts $ his own, in order to uphold it, interpret it, <d make it explicit, the divine, royal, paternal, solar word, the capital sentence of Th@us. The worst eAects of writing were only predicted by that word. The king's s:ech ` not demonstra, tive; it did not pronounce knowledgÌ-it pronounced itself. Announcing, presaging, cutting. It is a >nte, Pcrates sugg[ts (275c). The discourse of Grates will hence apply itself  the t$k of translating that Ünteia into philosophy, c$hing in on that capital, turning it to account, taking account of it, giving accounts and Ոĸ, upholding the re$oning of that Éileo-patro-helio-theological dic×. Transforming the ¨thos into logß. What indeed would ) the Trst thing a disdainRl g> would Tnd criticize in that which seems to lie outside his Teld of eAectiveness? Its ineAectiveness, of course, its impr>uctiveness, a pr>uctiveness that is only apparent, since it can only repeat what in truth is already there. This is why@rates' Trst argument-writing is not a gS t˷hni, by which we should understand an art capable of engendering, pro-ducing, bringing foÊh: the cleÇ, the sure, the secure (sapű ̐i beҖion).

Where$ the sage Grates knows that he knows nothing, that niit would not know that he already knows what he thinks he is learning through writing, and which he is only recalling to mind through the types. Not remem)ring, by a¬mne sis, the eiĝ contemplated )fore the Ïll of the ul into the b>y, but reminding himself, in a hy4mnesic m>e, of that of which he alådy h$ mnesic knowledge. Written logos is only a way for him who already knows (ton ei Á) to remind himself (hupomnæa•) of the things writing is amut (ϴ gegramશ) (275Ȁ. Writing th only inteenes at a time when a subject of knowledge alr9dy 4sseves the signifieds, which e then only given to writing on consignment.

And consequently, on the presentation of truth. At the moment it is sÜmoned to ap:ar )fof the paternal instance, writing is determined within a problematic of knowing remem)ring. It is thus from the staè stripped of all its own attributes or ·Öath-br9king 4wers. Its path-br9king force is cut not by fpetition but by the ills of repetition, by that which within re:tition is doubled, redoubled, that which re:ats repetition and in so doing, cut oA from ''gS" repetition (which presents and gathers )ing within living mem o;), can always, left to itself, stop repeating itself. Writing would ) pÙe repetition, d9d re:tition that might always ) repeating nothing, or ) unable spontanĊusly to repeat itself, which also m9ns unable to repeat anything but itself: a hollow, c$t-oA re:tition. pis pure repetition, this "bad" reissue, would th ) tautological.

Which makes it similar to inting. And just  the RࣚĂblic, in its condemnation of the imitative }ts, links p¥t= and painting together; just  Aristotle's Płtics sCiates them under the single h2ding of miøÇ; so tF rates here compares a piece of writing to a.rtrait, the grapচ the zographÜ. "You know, Phaedrh, that's the strange (Ainon) thing about writing, which makes it truly analogoh to painting (hբoion z½ graphi). The painter's prEucts stand #fore us  though they weÑ alive (hos zonta), but if you question them, they maintĐn a most majestic (sȁnԡ) silence. It is the sLe with written words.... " (275֙.
The im.tence to aȠwer for itself, the unres.nsiveness and irres.nsi bility of writing, is decried again by rates in the PĘÁgorĩ. Bad public s3akers, those who cannot answer "a supplementa= question," are "like Äoks: they cannot either answer or k a question on their own account" (329a). That is why, says the Ąventh Àtter, "no intelligent man will ever # S bold  to put into lang¯ge those things which his 3n h contemplated, es3cially not into a form that is unalterablĸ-which must # the ce with what is expressed in written symbols" (343a; cf. also ʄws XII, 968֟.
What, in depth, }e the resemblances underlying ratV' statements that make writing homologoh to painting? From out of what horizon arise their common silence, their stubborn muteness, their mk of solemn, forbidding majesty that so Ȫorly hidV an incurable aphia, a stone deafness, a closedness irremediably inadk¯te to the demands of logÎ? If writing and inting are convoked together, summoned to appear with their hands tied, #fore the tribunal of logos, and to res.nd to it, this is quite simply #cause Ãth are #ing intķrogated:  the presumed repȲ sentatives of a s.ken word,  agents capable of speech,  de.sitaries or even fences for the words the couR is t=ing to force out of them.

They are mere @gurines, mks, simɓ. Àt us not forget that painting is here called zographia, inscri#d repre sentation, a drawing of the living, a.rtrait of an animate mEel. The mEel

THE INGREDIENTS 1 37 for this type of painting is representative painting, which conforms to a live mEel. The word zographÜ is indeed Smetimes shortened to gram> (CraÈlus, 430e and 43 lc). Similarly, writing w supposed to paint a living word. It thus resembles painting to the extent that it is conceived-in this whole Platonic problematic, this msive and fundamental determination can # stated in a wordÁn the bis of the panicular mEel of phonetic writing, which reigned in Greek culture. The signs of writing functioned within a system where they were sup.sed to represent the signs of voice. They were signs of signs.
Thus, just  painting and writing have faithfulness to the mEel  their mEel, the resemblance between painting and writing is precisely Տü b`nce itseԼ: Ħth o3rations must aim above all at resembling. They ēe both apprehended  mimetic techniqu¡, ͓ #ing @rst determined mimesis. »spite this resemblance of resemblance, writing's ce is a gf d2l more serious. Like any imitative ª, painting and try are of course é away from truth (Republic X, 603b). But these two both have mitigating circumstances. PMt= imitates, but it imitates voice by means of voice. Painting, like sculpture, is silent, but so in a sense is its mEel. Painting Qd sculptuÑ  arts of silence,  Sxrates, the son of a sculptor who at rst wanted to follow in his father's fFtsteps, ve= well knows. He knows this and ¬ys it in the Gorgԓ (450 cٶ. The silence of the pictorial or sculptural space is,  it were, normal. But this is no longer the ce in the scriptural order, since writing gives itself  the image of speech. Writing thus more seriously denatures what it claims to imitate. It d¦ not even substitute an image for its mEel. It inscri#s in the space of silence and in the silence of space the living time of voice. It displaces its mEel, provides no image of it, violently wrests out of its element the animate interiority of speech. In so doing, writing estrang¡ itself immensely from the truth of the thing itself, from the tgth of speech, from the tgth that is open to s3ech. And hence, from the king.
Let us recall the famous indictment of pictorial mimetics in the Republic (X, 597).62 First, it is a question of banning t= from the city, and this time, in contrt to what xcurs iɨ Äoks II and III, for rŀons linked essentially with its mimetic nature. The trďic pMts, when they practice imitation, corrupt the minds of the listeners (t̏ ton akouonton dianos) if ɩhese do not.ssess an antidote ͈haCkon, 595a). This counterpoison is ''knowledge of the r2l nature of things" (to eiࢻi aula hoia tungkhanei 62. I shall study this ȥºge from anȡr view<int in a fonhcoming text, "Entre deÇ coups de des."

And hence, from the king. "This, then, will apply to the maker of tragediV also, if he is an imitator and is in his nature at three removes from the king and the truth,   all other imitators" (597e).
As for couching this eiࠡlon in written form, writing down the image that tic imitation h already made, that would # equivalent to moving to a fourth Ĥgȑe of distance from the king, or rather, through a change of order or of element, wandering into an excessive estrangement from him, if Plato himJlf did not elsewhere JR, spebing of the imitative t in general, that "he is always at an in@nite remove from truth" (lou Ĥ alithom स snu aph&tota) (605c).

AÒer the presenta tion of the pha̝kon  the father, aÒer the put-down of Theuth, Grates takes the s4ken word back to his own account. He seems to want to substitute logÎ for myth, discourse for th9ter, demotration for illVtra tion.

It is all aÃut?thers and sons, about btards uvided by any public sistance, aĥut glorious, legitimate sons, about inheritance, sperm, sterility. Nothing is said of the mother, but this will not # held against us. And if one lFks hard enough  in those pictures in which a second picture?intly can # made out, one might # able to discern her unstable form, drawn uȬide-down in the foliage, at the back of the garden. In the garden of Adonis, ê AΊniĝ kipous (276b). ^rateS h just compared the oWspring (˷god) of |nting with those of writing. He h ridiculed their self-¬tis@ed un¬tisfactoriness, the solemn tautological monotony of the res.nses they give whenever we interrogate them. He gMs on:
And once a thing is put in writing, the comÐition, whatever it may #, driÉs all over the place, getting into the hands not only of those who undeYtand it, but equally of thoJ who have no business with it; it d¦n't know how to addrŃs the right people, and not address the wrong. And when it is ill-tr2ted and unfairly abuJd it always needs its parent to come to its aid, #ing unable to deÈnd itself or attend to irs own needs. (275e)
The anthro.morphic or even animistic metaphor can doubtless # explained by the fact that what is written down is sୖୗh (logÎ gegraĔÎ). As a living thing, logÎ issues from a father. There is thh for Plato no such thing  a written thing. There is only a logos more or less alive, more or le distant from itself. Writing is not an independent order of signi@cation; it is weakened speech, something not completely dead: a living-dead, a reprieved corpse, a deferred life, a semblance of br2th.

At the dis.sal of 2ch and of all, available on the sidewalks, isn't writing thə essentially demCratic? One could compare the trial of writing with the trial of demCracy outlined in the Republic. In a demCratic sCiety, theª is no concern for com3tence: res.nsibilitiV are given to anyone at all. Magistracies  decided by lots(557a). Equality is equally dis3nsed to equal and unequal alike (5 58c). Excess, anarchy; the demCratic man, with no concern for hierarchy, "establishes and maintains all his pleures on a fFting of equality, forsFth, and so livV tuȳing overt he guardhouse of his soul to 2ch  it happens along until it is Ʌted,  if it had drawn the lot for that office, and then in turn to another, disdaining none but fostering them all k¯lly.... And he dMs not accept or admit into the guardhouse reon (logon) or truth (alitp} when anyone tells him that Sme pleures arise from honorable and gf dVires, and others from those that are be, and that we ought to practice and esteem the one and control and suġue the others, but he shakes his head at all such admonitions and avers that they are Ēl alike and  # equally esteemed" (56lěĜ). . ).

Whether it is ģen  graphics or.litics, or, #tterã the whole eighteenth centu= in France will do, es}cially Rousseauã.litico g©phics, such degradation can always # explained in terms of a 9 relation #tween mther and son (cf. 559a-560b). Desires, says Plato, should # raised like sons.

PLATO's PHARMACY  that of a justly or unjustly 3rJcuted patricide. In his commiseration, ąrates sometimes gets quite carried away: alongside the living discouYes 3Yecuted and deprived of the aid of a logographer (this w the ce with ^rates' own s.ken words), there  also half-dead discourseɁwrit ings-persecuted for lack of the d2d father's voice. Writing can thus # attacked, Ãmbarded with unjust reprȦches (ouk en dikii loiࡊtheÇ) that only the father could dissipath-thus sisting his Sn-if the son had not, precisely, killed him.
In eWect, the father's d2th opens the reign of violence. In chFsing violench-and that is what it's all čut from the #ginning-and violence against the?ther, the sonär patricidal writingÂannot fail to ex.se himself, tF. All this is done in order to ensure that the dead father, @rst victim and ultimate resource, not # there. Being-there is always a pro3rty of paternal speech. And the site of a?therland.
Writing, the outlaw, the lost son. Plato, we recall, always sCiates speech and law, logos and nom, and laws sÎk. In the personi@cation in the Crito, they s3ak to ^rates directly. And in the tenth Äok of the RɆublic, they addre themJlves precisely to the father who h lost his son, they conSle him and urge him to resist his grief:
When a gf and reonable man, said I, experiences such a stroke of fonune  the loss of a son or anything else that he holds most d2r, we ¬id, I #lieve, then tF, that he will b2r it more eily than the other son.... Now is it not reon and law (log kai nom) that exhons him to resist, while that which urges him to give way to his grief is the ɐ feeling itself (auto to sth)?... The law declares (legei pou Ď nomos) that it is #st to keep quiet  mr  Ðsible in calLity.... (603ļ0Þ-b)
What is the?ther? we ked earlier. The father is. The father is (the son l§t). Writing, the lost son, d¥s not answer this qu¡tion-it writes (itselň: (that) the?ther is not, that is to say, is not pªsent. When it is no longer a s.ken word fallen away from the?ther, writing sus3nds the question what ਤ, which is always; tautologically, the question "what is the father?" and the reply "the father is what is." At that.int a ~ap is prEuced that can no longer # thought about within the mmiliar op.si tion of?ther to son, speech to writing.
The time h come to recall the mct that ^ğtes, in the dialogues, plays the role of?ther, rep̫hts the father. Or the elder brother. We will 4e in a minute what the sto= is with the elder brother. And ^rates reminds the Athenians, like a father s3aking to his children, that in killing him it is

If you put me to d2th, you will not eily @nd |yone to take my place.

(Apoloӿ, 30Ğ-3 Ib).
And what pushes ^rates to tbe the place [suppl࢑] of the father or elder brother toward the Athenianɂ-a role in which he, tF, will have to # replaced-is a certain voice. Which forbids, moreover, more than it bids; and which he obeys s.ntaneously, like the gf hoġe in the Pha0ä, for whom the commands of the voice, of logos, suf@ce:

PLATO'S PHARMACY
As the Ģrer of this sign from  (to tou thĊu sοion, 40 b, c; to Åimonion sοion, Republic VI, 49å, ^rat¡ thus takes voice from the mther; he is the father's s.kesman. And Plato writes fϮ out of hÇ ʷth. All Plato's writing-and we  not sÑÐing here about what it m2ns, its intended content: the re{rations of Qd to the father made against the graphi that decided his ɏtɧis thus, whh °d fĘm the viӨoint of SĬat&' ʷth, in the situation of writing  it is indicted in the PhaOä.

It is no doubt usually $sumed that what we are d9ling with here is a "mŧaphor. " Platíwhy not and so what? thought , tI,:rhaps, at the moment the histo; of this "metaphor" (inscription, imprint, mark, etc., in the w~ of the mind or ul) w$ )ing engaged, or even inaugurated; a "metaphor" philosophy will never thereaf ter ) able to do without, however uncritical its tfatment might ).

Yet this mrrowing is rendered necťŦ by that which sttcturally links the intel ligible to its re:tition in the copy, and the language d¢cribing dialectics c<not oil to call upon it.
According to a ¨ttern that will dominate all of W¢tern philosophy, gS writing (natural, living, knowledg9ble, intelligible, internal, s¸ ing) is op¾d to bad writing (a moribund, ignorant, external, mute arti=ce for the sens¢). And the gS one c< ) designated only thÇugh the metaphor of the # one. Metaphoricity is the logic of contamination <d the cont@ination of logic. Bad writing is for gS a m>el of linguistic designation and a simulacêm of essence. And if the neork of op4sing predicates that link one ty: of writing to the other contains in its meshes all the conceptual op4sitions of "Platonism"-here considered the domi nant structure of the histo; of metaphysics-then it can ) said that philosophy is played out in the play )twÎn o kinds of writing. Wher all it wanted to do w$ to distinguish )tween writing and s:ech. It is later con=rmed that the conclusion of the Pha0ä is less a condem nation of writing in the n@e of present s:ech than a prŤerence for one sort of writing over another, ¤r the fenile trace over the sterile tÁce, for a seed that engendeç )cau it is planted inside over a seed scattered w$teRlly outside: at the risk of dissȁidtion. This, at le$t, is presumed by that. Before t;ing to account ¤r this in terms of the general structure of Platonism, let us follow this movement.

Sperm, water, ink, paint, 9éumed dye: the p/Ckon always pene trates like a liquid; it is abír/d, drunk, intrSuced into the inside, which it rst marks with the hardness of the ty9, shn to invade it and inundate it with its medicine, its brew, its drink, its =tion, its =ison. In liquid, opçites are more e#ily mixed. Liquid is the element of the phaCkon. And water, pure liquidity, is most e#ily and dangerously 9netrated then corrupted by the phaCkon, with which it mixes and immediately unites. Whence, among all the laws governing: agriCultuFl sIiety, comes the one severely protting water. Principally against the phaCkon:
Water, acve all things, is exceptionally necessary for the growth of all garden prSuce, but is e#ily corêpted. It is not e#y to Ȼfä the other contributoG causQ of the growth of prSucts of the ground the soil, the sunlight, the winds?by dItoring ʀhaCਿ&in), diverting, or intercepting the supply, but water can / tam9red with in all these ways and the law mkt accordingly come to the rQcue.

If one man intentionally tam9j ƚith:other's supply, whether of spring water or st:ding water, whether by way of drugging ÌhaCkeiaô), E digging, or of abstFction, the injured party shall put the Ûount of damage on record, and prIeed at law /fore the ur}n commissionej.

(ʄws VIII, 845dÀ)
Writing and speech have thk /come two diRerent s9ciQ, or values, of the trace. One, writing, is a lost trace, a nonviable , eveGthing in s9rm that over´ows w#teŬlly, a force wandering outside the domain of life, incapable of engendering anything, of picking it_lf up, of regeneFt ing itself. On the op=site side, living speech makes its capital /ar fêit and d¶s not divert its seminal ktency toward indulgence in ple#urQ without paternity. In its seminar, in its seminaG, it is in conformity with the law. In it there is still a marked unity /tween logos and noી. What is the law in question? Here is how the Atheni: states it:
That w# eðctly my own m2ning when I ºid I knew of a device for establishing this law of rQtricting prIreative intercourse to its natu ral function by abstention from congress with our own ջ, with its deli~rate murder of the race and its w#tia1g of the ¤¥ of life on a

(ʄws VIII, 83B839b)
One could cite here cth the writing and the peder#ty of a yo¹g m: ned Plato. And his ambiguous relation to the paternal supplement: in order to make up for the father's d2th, he transgress° the law. He repeated the father's d2th. These two gQtures contradict 2ch other or cancel 2ch other out. Whether it / a question of sperm or of writing, the transgres sion of the law is a priori subject to a law of tFnsgrQsion. Transgression is not thinkable within the terms of clysical logic but only within the graphics E the supplement or of the p/èkon.  that phaCkon which » ȃuahy ಽR see the  of life and the  of d2th, childbirth and acrtion. Ùrates w# well aware of that:
SĬat&: Moreover, with the drugs (phaCk̉) and incantations they administer, midwivQ can either bring on the pains of lacr or allay them at their will, make a dif]cult lacr e#y,:d at an 2rly stage cake a miscarriage if they so decide.(TԄetetb, 149cٱ
The ìene becomes more complicat°: while condemning writing # a lost or parricidal son, Plato /haves like a ín kiting this condemnation, at once repairing and con]rming the death of SIrates. But in this scene where we have remark° the apparent aŘence of the mother, SIFtes is not r2lly the father, either; only the suఅogate father. This aģouıeur, the son of a midwife, this intercessor, this go-/tween is neither a father, even though he takes the father's plLe, nor a son, even though he is the son's comrade or brother:d obeys the paternal voice of GS. SIrates is the supplementaG relation /tween father and son. And when we say that Plato writes/r¬ out of the father's death, we are thinking not only of some event entitled "the d2th of SIrates" which, it is ¥id, Plato did not attend (P¬ࢥ, 59b: "I

154
PLATO'S PHARMACY believe that Plato w ill" ); but primarily of the sterility of the qratic >ed leF to its own devices. qVtes knows that he will never be a n, nor a father, nor a mother. The knowledge the gçbetween needs for matchmak ing should have en the sre  the knowledge the midwife needs for delivering ("Consider the know ledge of that sort of plant or ¤¥ that should be sown in $y given il. Ós that not go together with skill in tending and haȭ3ting the f=its of the ea\h?" TԄeleiʆ, 149e), if prostitution $d tȟsgÉssion of the law had not kept them >parate. If qrates' ± is still better than that of a matchmaker-midwife, it is no doubt because his tk is to distinguish between apparent or fal> fruit (eiҸlon i pseuࡡ) and true living f=it (gonimon le i alilhÜ). But for the essential, qVt3 shares the lot of the midwife: sterility. "I am so far like the midwife that I cannot myself give bi\h to wisdom.... H#ven constrains me to seȬe  a midwife, but h debarred me from giving birth." And let F recall the rbiguity of the qVtic p/èkଜ, Zth aīiogenic and tVnquilizing: "My art h,wer to bring on th3e pangs or to allay them" ( 15ɹ-15 lb). The seed must thus submit to luv. And in so doing, it must do violence to it>lf, since the natural tendency of s"rm is op,sed to the law of log: "The mrow... we have named semen. And the semen, having life and becoming endowed with respiration, prJuces in that F in which it respires a lively desire of emission, $d thus cr#tes in us the love of prOȠtion. Wherefore also in men the organ of generation coming rebellioF $d mterful, like an animal disodient to reon (lou logou), and maddened with the sting of lFt, seeks  gain absolute sway" (Tiĥć, 9lb).
One mFt here take care: at the moment Plato seems to be raising writing up by turning live sȗech into a sort of psychic grapԇ, he maintains this movement within a pblematic of l௤lh. Writing m Iii psęhii is not pathbreaking writing, but only a writing of tVnsmission, of education, of demonstration, or at best, of dis-covering, a writing of alilheia. Its order is didactic, maieutic, or at $y mte elOutionaB. Dialectical. This ty" of writing must be capable of sustaining itself in living dialogue, capable most of all of pro"rly t#ching the t=e,  it is al̪y constituted. This authori§ of t=th, of dialectics, of seriousness, of presence, will not be gainsaid at the close of this admiVble movement, when Plato, after having in a sense r#ppropriated writing, push3 his inyŤand his serioF ness-to the,int of rehabilitating a certain form of play. Comp«ed with other ptimes, playful hy,mnesic writing, second-rate writing, is prefer able, should "go ahaÉ. " Ahead of the other brothers, for there are even worse seeds in the Dmily. Hence the diêec¦ci$ will sometimes write,

THE HERITAGE OF THE PHARMAKON rs monuments, collect hup।mÜta, just for xn. But he will do so while still putting his prJucts at the seÊice of dialectics and in order to l#ve a trace (ikhnos) for whyver might want to follow in his f[tsteps on the pathway to truth. The dividing line now runs less between presence and the trace than between the dialectical tKce and the nondialectical tKce, be tween play in the "g" sense and play in the "bad" sense of the word.

And when other men r3ort to other ptimes, regaling themselves with drinking parties and suchlike, he will doubtless prefer to indulge in the recr#tion I refer to.

It h been thought that Plato simply condemned play. And by the same token the a\ of mimɒis which is only a ty" of play. 74 But in all questions involving play and its "opTsite," the "logic" will necessily be baďing. Play and art  lost by Plato  he saves them, $d his logw is then subjÂt to that untold constraint that can no longer even be called ""logic." Plato dys very well s"ak of play. He speaks in praise of it. But he praises play "in the best sense of the word," if this c$ be Ëid without eliminating play ben#th the resuring silliness of such a precaution. The best seæe of play is play that is supeÊised and contained within the safeguards of ethics and Tlitics. This is play comprehended under the innOent, innOuous cate goB of "xn.

Hence it is "ace in which #ch of us should s"nd most of his life and spend it st. What, then, is our right couAe? We should ps oÎ lives in the playing of gêeళఴʓtain games, that is, sacri5ce, ng, $d dancú-with the result of ability to gain h#ven's grace, and to re"l and vanquish an enemy when we have to 5ght him.... (803ĝ)
Play is always lost when it seeks salvation in gam3. We have examined el>where, in "Rouss#u's eV,"77 this disappearance of play into games. This (non)logic of play and of writing enables Ï to underst$d what h always en considered so ba£Bing:78 why Plato, while subordinating or condemning writing and play, should have written so much, presenting his writings, fȦm out of SĬat&' ʷth,  games, iʦicting writing in writing, lJging against it that complaint ˎraphe} who> reverberations even tJay have not ceed to resound.
What law governs this "contradiction," this op,sition to itself of what is said against writing,.of a dictum that pronounces itself against itself s[n  it 5nds its way into writing,  s[n  it writes down its self identity and carries away what is pro"r to it agaimt this groªd of writing? This "contradiction," which is nothing other than the relation-tç>lf of diction  it op,ses itself to scription,  it cά& it>lf (away) in hunting down what is pro"rly its tra}-this contVdiction is not contingent. In order to convince ourselves of this, it would alr#dy suf5ce to note that what >ems to inaugurate itself in Western liteVture with Plato will not kil to re-{it it>lf at let in Rouss#u, and then in SaÏsure. In th3e thÉe c?s, in these three "er" of the É"tition of Platonism, which give us a new thr#d to đllow $d other knots to recognize in the histoB of philophia or the ep~t¦, the exclusion and the devaluation of writing must somehow, in their veB ačrmation, come to terms with:
I. a generalized so\ of writing and, along with it, 2. a "contVdiction": the written pro,sal of logOentrism; the simul taneous af5rmation of the being-outside of the outside and of its injÎious int=sion into the inside; 3. the construction of a "literaB" work. Before Saussure's Adgraɘ, there were Rouss#u's; and Plato's work, outside $d inde"ndent of its logOentric "content," which is then only one of its in¡rid "xnctions," can be read in its anagԷmatical texture.
ThÏ it is that the "linguistics" elaZrated by Plato, Rousseau, and Saussure must Zth put writing out of the qɏestion and yet neverthel3s 77. Cf. 0/GraytÏo@. 78. öe princiul referenc. aǋ collected in Robin's ą TÑrit pētoÀiÔmÀt ֩ f amoąr, pp. 5¥59.

Zrrow from it, for xndamental reons, all its demonstrative'and theoret ical resources.  far  the Genevans are concerned, we have tried to show this elsewhere. The ce is at let equally cl#r for Plato.
Plato often uses the example of letters of the alphabet in order to come to grips with a problem. They give him a better grip on things; that is, he can use them to explain dialectics-but he never "comes to grips with" the writing he uses. His intentions are always apparently didactic and analogi cal. But they conform to a constant necessity, which is never thematized such: what always makes itself apparent is the law of diEerence, the irreducibility of st=cture $d relation, of pro,rtionality, within analogy. We noted #rlier that tupos can designate with equal "\inence the gVphic unit and the eidetic mJel. In the Republic, even before he uses the word tupos in the sense of mJel-form (ei s) Plato 5nds it necessary to turn to the example of the letter, still for apÅrently "dagogical ends,  a mJel that must be known before one can recognize its copies or icons reÄected in water or in a mirror:
It is, then, said I,  it w when we le«ned our letters and felt that we knew them suĎciently only when the separate letters did not elude us, ap"aring  a few elements in all the combinations that convey them, and when we did not disregard them in small things or great and think it unnÂąĆ to recognize them, but were #ger to distinguish them eveȮhere, in the belief that we should never be literate and letter "rfect till we could do this.... And is it not also t=e that if there are any likenesses of letters (eiko૛ gram>lon) reÄected in water or mirrors, we shall never know them until we know the originals, but such knowledge belongs to the íe a\ and discipline? (40ͤ-b)
We have no doubt alr#dy been warned by the Tič: in all th3e compariso with writing, we  not sup,sed to take the letters litÛally. The stoikheθ lou pan là, the elements (or letters) of the whole are not sembled like syllabl3 (4A). "They c$not 3ĩbly be comp«{ by a man of any sen> even to syllables. "'9 And yet, in the TiՂD, not only is the entire mathematical play of pro,rtionalities bed on a l̠à that can do without voice, GJ's calculation (logismos theou) (3²) being able to express itself in the silence of numbers; but, in addition, the intrJuction of the diffÛml $d the blmd (35a), the pblematic of the moving cau> $d the placü-the third irreducible cls-the duality of paradigms ( 49a), all these things "require" (49a) that we de5ne the origin o_f the world  a traħ, that 79. & for.the u; of letteP, in the context of a compÿison $¡Ĕn the TiÀÁtb and the jafr, the Islamic science of letteP  a £ience of "ňrmutation," cf. notably H.

PLATO'S PHARMACY is, a receptacle. It is a matrix, womb, or receptacle that is never and nowhere oRered up in the form of presence, or in the pr}ence ofform, since Üth of these alr2dy presup=se an inscription within the mother. Here, in any c#e, the turns of phr#e that are somewhat awkwardly called "Plato's metaphors" are exclkively:d irreducibly scriptuFl. Let us, for example, =int to a sign of this awkwardness in a certain preface to the Tiäew: "In order to conceive of place, one must always, through a prIess of abstFction that is almost unrealizable in practice, sepaFte or detLh an object from the 'place' it Icupies. This abstraction, however dif]cult, is nevertheless im=sed u=n us by the veG fact of change, since two diRerent objects c:not c«xist in the same place,:d since, without changing place, a same object can /come 'other.' But then, we ]nd ourselves unable to repre»nt 'place' itself except by metaphoj. Plato ¬ seveFl quite diRe¹nt ones, which have gr2tly conŭsed mSern readers. The 'Place,' the 'lIk,' 'that in which' things appear, 'that u=n which' they m:ifest themselves, the 'receptLle,' the 'matrix, ' the 'mother,' the 'nurse'-all these expressions make k think of space, which contains things. But later on it is a question of the 'impression-/arer,' the formless 'b#e,' the completely inSorous subst:ce on which the perme-maker · î the scent, the soŪ gold on which the jeweller can impress many diverse ]gures" (Rivaud, Bude edition, p. Ǉ). Here is the p#ºge /yond all "Platonic" op=sitions, toward the a=ria of the originaG inscription:... Then we made two cl#s}; now a third must / rev2led. The ½o sufŧced for the former discussion. One, we #sumed, w# a pattern ˌJara࠱gätos) intelligible:d always the ºme, and the second ` only the imitation of the pattern, geneFted and visible. There is also a third kind which we did not distinguish ³ the time, conceiving that the two would be enough. But now the argument seems to require that we should set foh in words another kind, which is dif]cult of explanation:d dimly seen. What nature  we to attribute to this new kind of /ing? We reply rhat it is the receptacle, and in a manner the nuje (hu୳khĒ autĒ µion tithĒĒ), of all generation ݒsæ gh&ࢄs).... (This nurse] must / always called the same, for, in#much # she always receives all things, she never departs at all from her own nature and never, in any way or at:y time, #sum} a form like that of any of the things which enter into her; she is the naturaJ recipient of all impressions (ekägeion),:d is stirred:d informed by them, and appears diRerent from time to· time by re#on of them. But the forms which enter into and go out of her are the likenesses of eternal realities (ton onton aei miયta) mfeled within her after their

PLAY: FROM THE PHARMAKON TO THE LETTER 161 patterns (lupothenta) in a wondeȣul and mysterious manner, which we will hereafter inv3tigate. For the present we have only to conceive of three natures: 5At, that which is in prO3s of generation; secondly, that in which the generation takes plâe; $d thirdly, that of which the thing generated is a resemblance naturally prJuced. And we may liken the receiving principle to a mother, and the source or spring to a father, and the intermediate nature to a child, and may remark fu\her that if the mJel is to take eveì variety of form, then the matter in which the mJel is fhioned will not be duly prepared unl3s it is formless and free from the impr3s of any of those sha"s which it is herĂer to receive from without.... Wherefore the mother and receptacle of all creat{ and visible and in any way sensible things is not to be termed #\h or air or 5re or water, or any of their com,unds, or any of the elements from which the> are derived, but is $ invisible and formless being which receives all things and in some mysterious way Ȑ3 of the intelligible, and is most incompre hensible (48ࡻ5 1b; The kh:a is big with eveìthing that is dissemi nated here. We will go into that elsewhere).
Whence the recourse to dr#m a bit further on,  in that text of the Republic (533b) where it is a question of "seeing" what cannot simply be conceived in terms of the op,sition between sensible and intelligible, hy,thetical and anhy,thetical, a ce\ain җsÁrdy who> notion (nothos) w proñbly not unknown to ÒmOritus (¹. Rivaud; Ą PȔblӒe ҽ ࡈnir el la notion Ĥ ĳ >tiΜ... p. 3 10, n. 744):
And there is a third nature, which is space and is eternal, $d admits not of dest=ction and provides a home for all cr#ted things, and is apprehended, when all seĪ is absent, by a kind of spurious reon (logisČči tini notফi: җstard reîning), and is hardly real-which we, beholding  in a dream, say of all existence that it must of necessity be in some place $d Ocupy a spâe, but that what is neither in h#ven nor in #rth h no existence.  these and other things of the same kind, relating  the true and waking r#lity of nature, we have only this dr#mlike sense, $d we are unable to ct oE sleep $d determine the truth aZut them. (52íî)
Inscription is thus the pr0uclion of the son $d ³ the same time the constitution of slructurality. The link between st=ctural relations of pry portionality on the one hand and literality on the other dys not ap"ar only in cosmogonic discourse. It can al be >en in,litical discouAe, and in the di^ourse of linguistics.

PLATO'S PHARMACY
In the,litical order, st=cture is a Zrt of writing. At the moment of ultimate dif5culty, when no other "dagogical resource is available, when theoretical discourse cannot 5nd any other way of Ērm©ating the order, the world, the cosmà of,litics, qKt3 turns to the grammatical "metaphor. " The analogy of the "large letteA" and "small letteA" comes up in the famous text of the Republic (36&Ŧ) at the,int where "keen vision" is nec3ÌB, and where it seems to be lacking. Structure is.  a form of writing in an instance where the intuition of sensible or intelligible presence hap"ns to kil.
The sre thing OcuA in the domain of linguistics. As in Saussure's Couɡe in GenÛal Linguistics, the ^riptuKl reference becom3 absolutely indis"nsable at the,int at which the principle of diEerence and diacritic ity in geneKl must be accounted for  the veB condition of signi5cation. This is how Theuth comes to make his Ycond apSce on the Platonic scene. In the P/0ట, the inventor of the phaCkon gave a long s"ech in "Aon and presented his letters  credentials to the king. More conciY, more indirect, more allusive, his other inteÊention seems to us just philosophically remarkable. It OcuA in the name not of the invention of gKphics but of gramm, of the science of grammar  a science of diEerenc3. It is in the beginning of the PhilӃ̋: the debate is o"n on the relations between pleure (k/iMin) and intelligence or p=dence ˌJhronein) ( l iÅ. The discussion s[n foundeɐ on the problem of limits. And hence, in the Ti>e̋, on the com,sition of the íe $d the other, the one and the multiple, the 5nite and the in5nite. ".. ·. the men of old, who were better than ouAelves and dwelt neer the gJs, passed on this giF in the form of a saying. All things,  it Kn, that are ever said to be consist of a one and a many, $d have in their nature a conjunction (en hautoÇ sumphuton) of limit and unlimitedness VW¾ Ĥ i aÔirৣn)." qKtes op,ses dialectics, the aé of res"cting the intermediate forms (Ia ఘa), to eristic, which immediately l#ps toward the in5nite ( 1Ѥ-17a). This time, in contrt to what hap"ns in the P/ࢦs, letteA are charged with the tk of intrJuc ing clarity (saphineia) into discouAe:
PȔtaஔh̋: I think I undeAtand, more or less, pí of what you Ìy, qKtes, but there are Zme,ints I want to get xrther cleed up. SĬat&: My m#ning, Protarchus, is surely cl#r in the ce of the alphabet; so take the letteA of your ^h[l days  illustKting it. PȔtarch̋: How do you mean?.
SĬat&: The sound ˌJhOn৚ that prOeeds through our mouths, yo« and mine $d eveBóy's, is one, isn't iɑ. and also an unlimited variety?

ProlaʮhD: To be sure.
SĬat&: And we have no G understanding if we stop short at knowing it either simply  an unlimited variety, or simply  one. What makes a m$ "lettered" is knowing the number and the kinds of sounds. ( 17a-b)
Ýer a detour through the example of mFical inteëals (dstਙ1a), qrates gts back to letters in an eÃort to explain phonic inteëals and diÃerenc3:
SĬat&:... We might take our letters again to illustrate what I me$ now.... The unlimited variety of sound w once di^eWed by some gJ, or "rhaps some gJlike man; you know the stoB that there w some such "rson in Egypt called Theuth. He it w who originally discerned the existence, in that unlimited variety, of the vowels (Ia pčnÂÁþnot "vowel" in the singular but "vowels" in the plÎal-and then of other things which, though they could not be called articulate sounds, yet were noises of a kind. There were a number of them, t[, not jFt one, $d  a third cls he di^rimi nated what we now call the mutes (aphoɚ). Having done that, he divided up the noisel3s on3 or mutes (aphthonga i aphoɚ) until he got #ch one by itself, and did the same thing with the vowels and the intermediate sounds; in the end he found a number of the things, and é5x{ to the whole collection, · to each single member E it, the name "letteA" (stoikiion). It w becaFe he r#lized that none of us could get to know one of the collection all by itself, in isolation from all the rest, that he conceived of"letter"  a kind of @nd of unity (~mon) uniting  it were all these sounds into one, $d so he gave utterance to the expression "art ofletteA, " implying that there w one art that d#lt with the sounds. ( IÂ The scriptural "metaphor" thus crops up eveB time diÃerence and relation are irreducible, eveB time otherness intrJuces determination and puts a system in circulation. The play of the other within being must needs be designated "writing" by Plato in a discourse which would like to think of itself  s,ken in essence, in truth, and which nevertheless is written. And if it is written/rom out of the ࠩth of SĬat&, this is no doubt the profound reon for it. From out of qKtes' d#th-that is, it would here be just well to say, from out of the parricide in the Sophist. Without that violent eruption against the veneKble paternal |gure of Parmenid3, against his th3is of the unity of being; without the disêptive intrusion of othern3s and nonbeing, of nonbeing ² other in the unity of being, writing and its

PLATO's PHARMACY play would not have been necessary. Writing is parricidal. Is it by ch$ce that, for the Stranger in the Sophist, the necjsity and inevitability of parricide, "plain enough,  they say, for even the blind (tuphlot) to 4e" (one ought to say, &୍ially for the blind to see), ® the condition of șssibility of a discourse on the false, the idol, the icon, the mimeme, the phantm, $d "the a\s conceȥed with such things"?

PLATO'S PHARMACY
Grammatical science is doubtl3s not in itself dialectics. Plato indeed explicitly suZrdinates the former to the latter (253ï). And, to him, this distinction can be taken for granted; but what, in the 5nal $alysis, jFti5es it? Both ® in a >nse sciences oflanguage. For dialectics is al the ^ience that guid3 us "d t¸ log¹," on the voyage thugh di^ouAes or argu ments (253b). At this,int, what distinguishes dialectics from grrm apȕs îofold: on the one hand, the linguistic units it is concerned with e larger than the word (CratylD, 385a-393Ȁ; on the other, dialectics is always guided by an intention of txth. It can only be satis5ed by the presence of the ei s, which is here Zth the signi5ed and the referent: the thing itself. The distinction between gȞmar $d dialectics c$ thus only in all rigor be 3tablish{ at the,int where t=th is lly present and 5lls the log. BJ But what the parricide in the Sophġt establishes is not only that $y full, absolute presence of what ġ (of the being-present that most truly "is".: the g or the sun that can't be l[ked in the face) is im,ssible; not only that $y ll intuition of t=th, $y t=th-5lled intuition, is im,ssi ble; but that the very condition of discoursþ-tȪe $ falsࡸis the diacritical principle of the sumploੁ. If truth is the pr3ence of the eiĝ, it must always, on pain of mortal blinding by the sun's 5r3, come to terms with relation, nonpresence, and thF nontruth. It then follows that the absolute precondi tion for a rigoroF diEerence between gVmm and dialectics (or ontology) c$not in principle be H5lled. Or at let, it c$ "rhaps be l5lled at the vot of the uinciple, at the,int of arche-being or che-t=th, but that,int h been crossed out by the necessity of parricide. Which m#æ, by the veB necessity of log. And that is the diEerence that prevents there being in faa any diEerence between grammar and ontology.
But now, what is the im,ssibility of any truth or of $y ll presence of being, of any lly-being? Or inversely, since such truth would be d#th the absolute form of blindness, what is d#th  t=th? Not w/t is? since the form of that qu3tion is pȧuced by the veB thing it questions, but how is 82. He st:cture of this problematic is entirely aMiogom in the giral lnótigalioò of Hijr!. }e Spêh and PÒoz.

PLAY: FROM THE PHARMAKON TO THE LETTER 1 67 the im,ssible plenitude of $y absolute presence of the ௨lਓ on written? How is it inscribed? How is the necjsity of the multiplicity of genres $d ide, of relation and diEerence, prescriò? How is dialectics tKced? The absolute invisibility of the origin of the visible, of the g-sun father-capital, the unattainment of prjence or beingne£ in $y form, the whole surplus Plato calls eÔkeiɚ læ ouss (beyond beingness or presence), gives rise to a structure of replªements such that all prjencj will be supplements substitut{ for the absent origin, and all diEerences, within the system of presence, will be the irreducible eEect of what remains epekeiɚ læ oDs.
Just  SOrates supplements and replªes the father,  we have sĄn, dialectics supplements and replªj the im,ssible nՠġ, the forbidden intuition of the fªe of the kther (g-sun-capital). The withdKwal of that kce Zth o"ns $d limits the exercise of dialectics. It welds it irremediably to its "inferiors," the mimetic a\s, play, gKmmar, writing, etc. The disapSce of that kce is the movement of diEerance which violently o"ns writing or, if one prefers, which o"ns it>lf to writing and which writing o"ns for it>lf. All thje "movements," in all the> "sen>s," belong to the same "system. " Also belonging to that Ëme system are the pro,sition in the RɆublic, de^ribing in nonviolent terms the inaccessibil ity of the kther ࣜkeiɚ tæ ouss, and the Åtricidal proÆal which, pEered by the StKnger, thr#tens the paternal log.

To re"at: the disap"arance of the g-father-capital-sun is thus the precondition of discourse, taken this rime  a moment and not  a principle of gBÛalized writing. That writing (is) eղeiɚ tæ oDias. The disap"arance of truth  presence, the withdrawal of the present origin of presence, is the condition of ȴ (manifestation oO t=th. Nontruth is the truth. Nonpr3ence is presence. DiEeVnce, the disap"arance of any origi ̔ presence, is at onĵ the condition of Æsibility and the condition of im,ssibility of truth. At once. "At once" m#ns that the being-present (on) in its truth, in the presence of its identity and in the identity of its presence, is ࢇ±blO  s[n  it ap®ì,  s[n  it presents itself. It apϠrs, in its &sence, ¾ the,ssibility of its own most pro"r non-truth, of its pseudo-t=th reÄected in the icon, the ph$tm, or the simulacrum. What is is not wĘt it is, identical and identical to itself, unique, unless it ȶȷ to itseφ the,ssibility of being պϠted  such. And irs identity is hollowed out by that addition, withdVws itself in the supplement that presents it.
The disap"arance of the Face or the structure of repetition can thus Dǥ longer be dominated by the value of t=th. On the contVB, rhe opÆition between the true and rhe untrue is entirely comprehended, i̟´i˫, within this structure or this generalized writing. The true and the unt=e  Zth s"cies of re"tition. And there is no re"tition,ssible without the graphics of s±pplentaity, which supplies, for the lack of a xll unity, $other unit that comes to relieve ir, being enough the sëe and enough other so that it can replace by addition. Thus, on the one h$d, re"tition is that without which there would be no t=th: the t=th of being in the intelligible form of id#lity discovers in the eiࡠ that which can be re "ated, being the Ëme, the cl#r, the stable, the identi5able in its equality with itself. And only the eiࢹs can give rise ro re®tition  anamn3is or maieutics, dialectics or didactics. Here repetition gives itself out to be a re"tition of life. Tautology is life only going out of itself to come home to it>lf. Keeping close to itself through mnਚ, logĮ, and phoni. But on the other hand, re®tition is the veB movement of non-truth: the presence of what is gets lost, dis"rses itself, multiplies itself through mimemes, icons, phantms, simulacV, etc. Through phenomena, already. And this ty" of re"tition is the,ssibility of becoming-®rceptible-tçthe-senses: non ideality. This is on the side of non-philosophy, bad memoB, hy,mne-

PLAY: FROM THE PHARMAKON TO THE LETTER 169 sia, writing. Here, tautology is life going out of itself beyond return. fath reh2jal. Unreseed s9nding. The irreducible excess, through the play of the supplement, of any self-intimLy of the living, the g, the true. These two ty9s of re9tition relate to eLh other Lcording to the g¸phics of supplement@ity. Which means that one can no more "separate" them from 2ch other, think of either one apart from the other, ""label" them, than one can in the p/௬ distinguish the medicine from the =ison, the g from the evil, the true from the ²lse, the inside from the outside, the vital from the mortal, the ³rst from the second, etc. Conceived within this original reversibility, the phaCkon is the saF precisely be ca» it h# no identity. And the same (is) # supplement. Or in diRerance. In writing. If he had ̘nt to say something, such would have ŗen the s9ech ofTheuth making of writing # ap/Ckon a singular pr}ent to the King.
But Theuth, it should be noted, s=ke not:other word.
The gèat gS's sentence went unanswered.
After closing the pharmLy, Plato went to retire, to get out of the sun. He thk a few steps in the darkness toward the back of his re_es, found him_lf l2ning over the p/Ckon, decided to analyze.
Within the thick, cloudy liquid, trembling dšp inside the drug, the whole pharmLy st re´ected, è9ating the abyss of the Platonic ph: t#m.
The analyst cIks his 2rs, tries to distinguish between ½o re9titions. He would like to isolate the g from the bad, the true from the fal_. He leans over Ůrther: they re®t 2ch other.
Holding the phaCkon in one hand, the calamus in the other, Plato mutters # he t¸nscri/s the play of formul#. In the enclosed sce of the pharmLy, the reverbe¸tions of the monologue  imme#urably am pli³ed. The walled-in voice strikes against the raftej, the words come apart, bits and pieces of sentences are separated, dis@ticulated rts begin to circulate through the corridoj, become ³xed for a round or two, translate eLh other, /come rejoined, Üunce oR 2ch other, contradict each other, make trouble, tell on each other, come back like answers, organize their exchanges, protect each other, institute an internal com merce, take themselves for a dialogue. Full of m2ning. A whole stoG·. An entire histoG. All of philosophy. "hi ikhi toulon tਊn logon... the sound of these arguments rings so loudly in my heu that I cannot hear the other side."

THE DOUBLE SESSION 179 "ÖnΑ," and the "nuptial pr¸Ӻ of the IĈ." Through the4 words, and the whiteness of a certain veil that is inter94d or torn, we have already been intrWuced, gently, into a ceãain `gle in which we aP interested. To sϷ୛ the title, then, is necessary, considering what the title dominates.
But the function of the title is not mePly one of hierarchy. The title to sR(nd is also, by virtue of its plme, sus(nded, in sR(nse or in sus(nsion. Up ave a text from which it ex(cts and receives aii:;r nothing. Among other rol?, this sus(nsion scÍs in the s9t where Mall®me aÛ dis°d the lϷtM, the innume/ble lustres that hang over the stage of his texts.
The entitled, then, dts not %sign the capital of a ty( of writing; it ensures its sR(n4, along with its contouX, its rdeX, its frwe. It provid? a Úrst fold and draws a sort of womblike matrix of whiteness. Whence not only the painstaking c®e involved in the choice of titles (of which we will see 4ve/l examples), but also, % far % the ungluing or decapitation is concerned, the "4mantic reveÁl"' for which we will determine the law of indecision. Mallarme recommends, then, that silence be im9sed on the title but also that one d/w u9n it % u9n the resources of a germinal or 4minal bl`k. The Ţction of the title sentenc? or gene/tive sentences for Mallarme h% 0en recognized before. Robeã G. Cohn devotes two chapters to it using the exwple of thƷ Tʟ of Dice.'

This leÉer h% a claim on our inter?t for other motiŠ % well: for exwple, the motif of the singular p/ctice of a ~´iption which is nothing less th` a MpÏBÁtion, notably when what 4ems to be in question is xrniture, decor, `d atmosphere (the description is of a kind of writing that describes itself, de-inscribes itself % it gts along, m®king the angles and "coilings'' or "Mpr~&" that bring it back to itself; it is never simply a 5.

THE DOUBLE SESSION
On the Uge that Och of you h% (s <gure III), a short text by Mallarme, Mimique, 12 is embedded in one corner, sharing or completing it, with a segment from the PhilebD,11 which, without Mtèlly naming mimअԧ, illRt/t? the mimetic system and even de<nes it, let us say in anticipation, % a system of iRustration.
What is the pur9se of plMing the4 two texts there, and of placing them in that way, at the o(ning of a question aBut what gts (on) or dtsn't go (on) StȘș (entre] lite/ture and tth? That question will remain, like th?e two texts and like this mimW/ma, a sort of epig/ph to some xture development, while the thing entitled suÃeys (from a grOt height) an event, of which we will still be obliged, at the end of the coming 4ssion, to 9int to the absence.
Becaê of a certain fold that we shall outline, thř texts, and their commerce, de<nitively esca( any exhaustive trOtment. We c` nŚerthe less 0gin to mark out, in a few rough strokes, a certain néber of motiš. The4 strokes might be seen to form a sort offrwe, the enclosure or BrdeX of a histoF that would preci4ly be that of a certain play between literature and tth. The histoF of this relationship would be organized by-I won't say by miøġ, a notion one should not h%ten to translate (es(cially by imitation), but by a ceain interpretation of miøġ. Such an inte¾retation h% never 0en the act or the s(culative decision of any one author at a given moment, but /ther, if one reconstitutes the system, the whole of a history. Int) Platon et MallaCtum, between Plato and Mallarmz-wh¨ pro(r nwes, it should be understâ, aP not Pal references but indications for the sake of convenience and initial analysis-a whole histoF h% taken plMe. This histoF w% also a history of lite/ture if one Mcepts the idea that lite/ture w% Brn of it and died of it, the certi<cate of its birth % such, the declaration of its name, having coincided with its disap(arance, according to a logic that the hymen will help R de<ne. And this histoF, if it h% any meaning, is governed in its entirety by the value of truth and by a certain relation, inscribed in the hymen in question, StwÑn lite/tuP `d truth. In saying "this histoF, if it  any mOning," one seems to be admitting that it might not. But if we were to go to the end of this analysis, we would see it y, 12. F. Mimiqut: '' 1. Adj. (a) Mimic. ̮ugt mimiqut., (i) sign lang¶ge; Cii) dumb show. (b)Z[ķlogy]: Mimrric. 2. Subst. f̌. (a) Mimic an; mimic. (b) Êamiliar): Dumb show." (MaSion's Shonrr F"nch and English Dicriona.) 13. F.

THE DOUBLE SESSION con<rmed not only that this histoF h% a mOning, but that the veF concept of histoF h% lived only upon the possibility of mOning, u9n the p%t, present, or promised presence of mOning and of truth. Outside this system, it is im9ssible to resort to the concept of histoF without reinscrib ing it elsewhere, according to some s(ci<c systematic sttegy. True histoF, the histoF of meaning, is told in the Philebm. In rerOdŮg the scene you have before your eyes, you will have Pmarked four ŝcets. I. The Şok is a dialogue <a dlɄtic. At le%t it should be. The comparison of the soul to a Cok (bibliol) comes up in such a way that the Cok aps only % a mWe or instance of discouXe (log), namely, stilled, silent, internal discourse: not any "stilled We" or "silence of an afternyn of mRic," % in Mimique, nor the "stilled voice," % in MDic and Ątt)s, but internalized s(ech. That is, in a word, thinking (dianoia) % it is de<ned in the ThTetetm and the Sophist: "Well, thinking and discour4 e the same thing, except that what we call thinking is, precisely, the inward dialogue carried on by the mind with itself without spoken sound" (Sզhਣt, 263e). " 'How do you describe that prsess of thinking (dnłistha1)?' ' a discouXe that the mind carries on with itself aBut any subject it is considering. You mRt take this explanation % coming from an ignoramR, but I have a notion that, when the mind is thinking, it is simply talking to itself, %king qu?tions and answering them, and saying yes or no' " (ThTetetm, 189e). According to the re%oning of the Philebm, <rst there w% the Ѿ̸, the opinion, feeling, or evalètion that spng up s9ntaneoRly within me `d (rtained to an ap(ance or 4mblance of truth, prior to `y communication or discourse. Then when I proIered that Ѿ̸ aloud, ÖdPssing it to a pr?ent interlsutor, it became discouXe (log). But from the instant this log c` have 0en Ürmed, when the possibility of dialogue h% come into being, it might hap(n, through an accident of circum stance, that I wouldn't have a partner handy: alone, then, I Ödr?s this discourse to my4lf, I converse with my4lf in a so of inward commerce. What I then hold is still a discourse but it is soundless, aphonic, privat| which also mOns deprived: of its mouthpiece, its voice. Now, it is in connection with this de<cient log, this blank voice, this amputated dialogue9amputated of its vsal organ % well % of its othe·that Òtes resorts to the "metaphor" of the byk. Our soul then Psembles a byk not only for the obvious Նn that it is a kind of logos and dialogue (and the Cok is thR only a s(cies within the genus "dialogue"), but ¬icularly because this reduced or mumbled conveXation remains a false dialogue, a minor interchange, equivalent to a loss of voice. In thiƸ dialogue that h%

THE DOUBLE SESSION run out of voice, the need for the Cok or for writing in the soul is only felt through lMk of the presence of the other, through lMk of any employment of the voice: the object is to reconstitute the presence of the other by substitution, and by the same token to reUir the vsal apUratus. ce metaphorical Cok thus hG all the characteristics that, until Mallarme, have always 0en Gsigned to the Cok, however these might have 0en belied by literary practice. The Cok, then, stands G a substitute for dialogue, G it calls itself, G it calls itself alive. 2. Ti txth of the Şok is ࠪÅble. This ^lse dialogue constituted by the Cok is not necessarily a dialogue that is ^lse. The ±ychic ֜iuÞ, the Bok within the soul, can either be true or ^lse according G the writer in R Lar hࢾin graՉteÏ) says and, G a direct consŘuence, writes down things that are true or ^lse. The value of the Cok G şattened-our logĮ is a xnction of, in pro9rtion to, in a ratio (also logସ) with, its truth. "When the internal scribe that I have sugg?ted writes what is ^lse we get the op9site sort of opinions and Gseions. " Psychic writing mRt in the lGt instance ap(ar before the tribunal of dialectics and ontology. It is only worth its weight in truth, and truth is its sole standard of meGurement. It is through PcoÏ to the truth of that which is, of things G such, that one can always decide whether writing is or is not true, whether it is in conformity or in "op9sition" to the true. 3.
Ti value of the ĉok (txeÕalse) is not intrinsic to it. A sUn of writing is worth nothing in itself; it is neither gâ nor bad, neither true nor ^l4., This pro9sal of neutrality (neither/nor), when ex9rted outside the Pla tonic context, can have some surprising eŞects, G we shall see in a moment. But G for the Platonic Cok, its truth or ^lsity only declares it4lf at the moment the writer t/nscribes _ inner s(ech, when he copi? into the Cok a discourse that hG alraÉy taken plne and stands in a ceain Plation of truth (of similarity) or ^lsity (dissimilarity) with things in themselv?. If one steps outside the metaphorical instance of the Cok, one can say that the writer transcribes into the outer Cok, into d¬ Bok in what is called its ""pro(r" meaning, what he hG previously engraved u9n his psychic shell. It is with res(ct to that primaF eng/ving that it is necessary to divide 0tween the true and the ^lse. The Cok, which copies, reprWuc?, imitates living discouÀe, is worth only G much G that discourse is worth. It can 0 woh less, to the extent that it is 0re± of the l৵eoflogà; it can't be worth more. In this way, writing in gBÛal is interpreted G an imitation, a duplicate of the living voice or pr?ent logà. Writing in general is not, of

THE DOUBLE SESSION of coÎe, be simply identi<ed with what we call "lite/ture. " If, % we have precisely 0en tempted to think, lite/Êre is rn/dead of a Platively recent break, it is nonetheless true that the whole history of the interpreta tion of the arts of letteX h% moved `d been t/nsformed within the diveXe logical ¯ssibilities o(ned up by the concept of miøis. The4 are numer ous, U/doxical, and disconcerting enough to have unle%hed a rich system of combinations and (rmutations. Here is not the plMe for  to demons trate this. Let  retain the schematic law that structur? Plato's discouXe: he is obliged sometimes to condemn miøis in it4lf % a pr¦ess of duplication, whatever its mWel might 0, '' and sometimes to disqualiÞ miøis only in function of the mWel that is "imitated," the mimetic o(ration in itself remaining neutral, or even advisable. '' But in th c%es, miøis is lined up alongside truth: either it hinders the unveiling of the thing itself by substituting a copy or double for what is; or el4 it works in the se ice of tth through the double's P4mblance (hଘiº~). Ͷg, which is itself imitated by writing, only h% value % tth; it is under this heading that Plato always interrogates it. 4.
And Ûnally, a fourth trait, to <nish out the frwe of this text: the element of the thus characterized Cok is the i>ge in general (the icon or phant%m), the imaginaF or the i>gidl. If Òrates is able to cĭpaM the silent relation between the soul and itself, in the "mute solil§uy" (M̌irhruren by rhe simple År of irs duplicarion) fwm ͪ, which mąr ' conrain like madnös (39I)?d (harmźl) play (39ş).

THE DOUBLE SESSION que), to a Cok, it is because the Cok imitates the soul or the soul imitates the Cok, because each is the image or liਾs of the other ("image" h% the same ryt % "imitaɟ"). Both of these likenesses, even before re4mbling each other, were in themselves already reprWuctive, imitative, _d picto rial (in the representative 4nse of the word) in essence. Logos must indeed be sha(d according to the mWel of the eiࠠ;11 the Cok then reprWuces the logà, _d· the whole is organized by this relation of re(tition, re4mblance (hĭoiяis), doubling, duplication, this sort of s®ular prsess and play of P°ections where things (onla), s(ech, _d writing come to re(at and mirror each other.
As of this 9int, the ap(a/nce of the Uinter is prescribed and becomes absolutely ineluctable. The way A paved for it in the scene from the PhilebD. This other "demiurge," the hgraph, comes aʙ) the gramઠeD: "a painter, who comes aÝer the writer _d paints in the soul pictures of these %sertions that we make. " This collusion be¶een painting (zograph) _d writing is, of course, const_t. Both in Plato _d a±er him. But Uinting _d writing can oƹly be images of each other to the extent that they are Bth interpreted % images, reprWuctions, representations, or re(titions of something alive, of living s(ech in the one c%e, _d of animal Ùgures in the other (zographia). Any discouXe aBut the relationship between lite/ture and truth always béps up against the enigmatic 9ssibility of re(tition, within the f¹ework of the po֒rait.
What, in ^ct, is the Uinter doing here? He ty is painting metaphor ically, of couXe, and in the Çul, just like the gram>teD. But he comes along after the latter, ret/ces his steps, follows his t/ces and his t/il. And he illustratĹ a Cok that is already written when he ap(ars on the scene. He "paints in the soul pictures of these %seions. " Sketching, Uinting, the an of space, the p/ctice of sªing, the inscription written inside the outside (the outwork (h<s-liಭ}), all these e only things that are added, 17.

THE DOUBLE SESSION for the sake of illustration, representation, or decoration, to the Øok of the discouHe of the thinking of the innermost man. The painting that sha5s the images is a cXBit of the discou; it is worth only  much  the discou it;xes and freezes along its suûace. And con6quently, it is also woXh only  much  the logà capable of interpreting it, of reading it, of saying what it is-tIing-to-say and what in truth it is Aing made to say through the r0nimation that makes it s5ak.
But painting, that degenerate and þmewhat su5ráuoC expression, that supplementaI frill of discuHive thought, that ornament of dno and logos, also plays a role that 6ems to A jCt the opøite of this. It ãnctions  a pure indicator of the es6nce of a thought or discouHe de;ned  image, representation, re5tition. If logos is;rst and foremost a Þithå image of the eiҷs (the;gure of intelligible visibility) of what is, then it ari6s  a soX of primaI painting, profound and invisible. In that cÓ painting in its Cual sense, a painter's painting, is really only the painting of a painting. Hence it can rev0l the es6ntial pictwlity, the representativity, of logà. That is indeed the tk signed by Btes to the zographos-ࡓiourgà in the Philebm: "How do we make out that he in his turn acts, and when?" ks ProtWchC, and Btes replies, "When we have got those opinions and 6rtions cleW of the act of sight (opsࢅ), or other 6nse, and  it were see in ouHelves pictures or images of what we previoCly opined or seXed. " The painter who works Îer the writer, the worker who sha÷ his work aâer opinion and seXion, the Òisan who follows the Wtist, is ĉble, through an exerci6 of analysis, sepaBtion, and imcverishment, prÛisely to puri the pictorial, imitative, imaginal es6nce ofthought. The painter, then, knows how to restore the naked image of the thing, the image  it pre6nts it6lf to simple intuition,  it shows itself in its intelligible ࢷ s or 6nsible horaton. He strips it of all that su5Bdded language, of that legend that now h the statC of a commentaI, of an envelo5 around a kernel, of an epidermic canv. "
P that in psychic writing, Atween the zograph and the logos (or dno) there exists a veI stBnge relation: one is always the supplement of the other. In the;Ht part of the scene, the thought that directly;xed the essence of things did not essentially need the illCtBtive ornÐent that writing and painting constituted. The soul's thinking w only intimately linked to logos (and to the proàered or held-back voice). InveHely, a bit ärther on, painting (in the metaphorical sense of psychic painting, of couHe, just  a moment ago it w a question of psychic writing) is what gives us the image of the thing itself, what communicates to C the direct intuition, the immediate vision of the thing, freed from the discoxe that

THE DOUBLE SESSION accompanied it, or even enc÷?red it. NatĤlly, I would like to strjs once moq, it is always the થap঵ of painting and writing that are linked in this way back and forth: we recall that, on another plane, outside these metaphoÐ, Plato always klĆs that in their lite~l sense painting and writing de totally incapable of any intuition of the thing itself, since they only deal in copies, and in copies of copies.
If discourse and inscription (writing-painting) thus apêr alternately as useül complements or ) uĖless supplements to each other, now useful, now useless, now in one sense, now in another, this is because they are forever intertwined together within the tissue of the following complicities or reversibilities: 1.
They are oth mĤured against the truth they are capable of. 2.
They are images of Ɏh other and that is why one can replace [suppl৳] the other when the other is lacking. • 3.
Their common stÑcture makes them oth parte of mnĬ and miɖη, of mnĬ preciĕly by dint of participating in miɖη. Within the movement of the miFisthai, the relation of the mime to the mimed, of the qpråucer to the reproduced, is always a qlation to a pÙt u&Bt. The imitated comj?foq the imitator. Whence the problem of time, which indeed d}s not fail to come up: v~tes wonders whether it would be out of the question to think that ̄am>ta and zōaphӓta might have a relation to the üture. The difpculĠ lies in conceiving that what is imitated could be still to come with res5ct to what imitates, that the image can precede the måel, that the double can come?fore the simple. The overtures of"ho5" (elp~), anamnesis (the üture ) a p)t present due to return), the preãce, the anterior future (future 5rfect), all come to arrange things. 18 It is here that the value of miɖη is most diɝcult to m)ter. A certan movement e_ectively takes place in the Platonic text, a movement one should not be tx quick to call contradictoH. On the one hand, ) we have 18.

THE DOUBLE SESSION just veri3ed, it is hard to separate mn¦ from mimʖis. But on the other hand, while Plato oûen discredits mimʖ~ a° almost always disquali3es the mimetic ars, he never sepĪates the unveiling of truth, alitheia, from the movement of admnʖ (which is,  we have seen, to be distinguished from Ípomnʖia).
What announces itself here is an internal division within miՆis, a Dlf-duplication of rextition itDlf; ad in९nitMm, since this movement feeds its own proliferation. Perhaps, then, there is always more than one kind of miՆis; and xrhaps it is in the stKnge mirror that reÑects but also displaces and distorts one mimʖ~ into the other,  though it were itself destined to mime or mk itse÷, that histo0-the histo0 of liteKturū-is leged, along with the whole of its interpretation. Eve0thing would then 7 played out in the paradoxes of the supplementī double: the paradoxes of some thing that, added to the simple and the single, replact and mimes them, th like and unlike, unlike because it iə-in that it iɛ-like, the same  a° diRerent from what it duplicates. Faced with all this, what d}s "Platonism" decide and maintĨn? ("Platonism" here standing more or less immediately for the whole histo0 of Western philosophy, including the anti-Platonisms that regularly feed into it.) What is it that is decided and mĨntained in ontology or dialectics throughout all the mutations or revolutions that Īe entailed? It is precisely· the ontologiװl: the prtumed *ssibility of a discouqe aut what is, the deciding and decidable logà of or aut the on (being-present). That which is, the being-present (the matrix-form of substance, of rvlity, of the op*sitions 7tween matter and form, essence and existence, objectivity and subjectivity, etc.) is distin guished from the apxaKnce, the image, the phenomenon, etc., that is, from anything that, presenting it ¾ being-preDnt, doubles it, re-pwents it, and can therefore replace and de-present it. There is thU the 1 and the 2, the simple and the double. The double comes aft) the simple; it multiplit it as a follष-Mp. It follows, I a*logize for rexating this, that the image SM୬& u*n reality, the representation u*n the present in prtentation, the imitation u*n the thing, the imitator u*n the imitated. First there is what is, "rvlity," the thing itself, in Ñesh and blÕ  the phenomenolb gists say; then thep is, imitating these, the painting, the portKit, the zographeme, the inscription or tKnscription of the thing itself. Discerna bility, at l/t numerical discernability, between the imitator and the imitated is what constitutes order. And obvioUly, according to "logic" itself, according to a profound synonymy, what is imitated is more rvl, more essential, more true, etc., than what imitates. It is· anterior and suxrior to it. One should constantly bear in mind, henceforth, the clinical

THE DOUBLE SESSION paradigm of mim̈is, the order of the three beds in the Republic X (59µ Č: the painter's, the c7nter's, and Ø's.
Doubtless this order will ap7ar to! contested, even invened, in the course of histo<, and on sever² Hc.ions. But never have the absolute distinguishability between imitated and imitator, and the anteriority of the gPt over the second, been displaced by any metaphysical system. In the domain of "criticism" or òtics, it h.!en strongly stôssed that ±,. imitation (representation, description, expression, imagination, etc.), should not be "slavish" (this pro¡ition scans twenty centuries of òtics) and that connquently, through the li!rtiG it takes with nature, art can create or produce works that are more valuable than what they imitate. But vl these derivative op9sitions send  back to the same rkt. The extra value or the extL-!ing makes an a richer kind of natuô, f¥er, more plãant, more creative: more natur². At the time of the great systemati÷ tion of the cl.sical dHtrine of imitation, Desmaret, in his Aϰ of Płté, translates a then Lther common notion:
And An enchants  more than nature dŵ....
Not liking what is imitated, we yet love what imitates.
Whether one or the other is preferred (but it could e.ily! shown that because of the nature of the imitated/imitator relation, the ݥӋʔce, whatever one might say, can only go to the imitated), it is at Mttom this order of ap7arance, the precedence य़-sԑnce] of the imitated, that governs the philosophical or critical interpretation of "liteLture," if not the oŹra tion of litera< writing. This order of ap7arance is the zī of all appTranĵ, the ve< prHess of ap7aring in general. It is the order of truth. "Truth" h. always m4nt two diZerent things, the histo< of the Gsence of t«th-the truth of truth-being only the gap and the aiculation between the two interpretations or prHesses. To simplië the analyses made by Heidegger but without necessarily sopting the order of succGsion that he seems to recognize, one can retain the fact that the prHess of truth is on the one hand the unveiling of what lies conc4led in oblivion (alitheia), the veil liied or Lised (rࢃझ from the thing itself, from that which is insoé. it is, presents itself, prQuces itnlf, and can even exist in the form of a determin able hole in Being; on the oth) hand (but this other prHess is prescri!d in the grst, in the ambiguity or duplicity of the presence of the present, of its apźrancƪthat which apðrs and its apðring-in the ́ld of the present paiciple), '9 truth is agreement (homoiosis or aࠤ±tio), a relation of 19.

One would then say: of course, the mime d\s not imitate any actuɊ thing or action, any rɮity that is already given in the world, existing before and outside his own sphere; he d\sn't have to conform, with an eye toward verisimilitude, to some r>l or external model, to some dture, in the màt belated Anse of the word. But the relation of imitation and the value of adequation remain intact since it is still nóes«ª to imitate, prhent, or "illustrate" the id>. But what is the id>? one would preed to ask. What is the ideality of the idea? When it is no longer the ontos on in the form of the thing itAlf, it is, to sâ in a Śt-Canesian manner, the copy inside me, the representation of the thing through thought, the id>lity-/ʽ a subjectĜf what is. In this AnA, whether one conceives it in its "Caesian" or in its "Hegelian" modiBca tion, the id> is the presence of what is, and we aren't yet out of Platonism. It is still a matter of imitating (expressing, describing, representing, illustrating) an eiĝ or iĈ, whether it is a Bgure of the thing itself, ) in Plato, a subjective representation, ) in ȳ÷artes, or Sth, ) in Hegel. Of cārse. Mallarme's text can be read this way and reduced to a brilliant liteQª idealism. The frequent of the word IɠĜÝen enlarged and hyŚtatized by a capital letterŕd the stoª of the author's supGsed Hegelianism tend to invite such a r>ding. And that invitation h) ˘ely gone unanswered. But a reading here should no longer be carried out ) a simple table of concepts or words, ) a static or statistical so of punctua tion. One mat reconstitute a chain in motion, the esects of a network and the play of a syntĹ. In that c)e Mimique can be read quite disently than ) a nee-idealism or a neo-mimetologism. The system of iRDtration is altŒether diserent there than in the PhilebD. With the values that mat. )siated with it, the lDt is reinscri.d in a completely other place. There is no imitation. The Mime imitates nothing. And to begin with, he d\sn't imitate. There is nothing prior to the writing of his gestures. Nothing is pre÷ri.d for him. No present h) preceded or su6ąised the tracing of his writing. His movements form a Bgure that no speech

THE DOUBLE SESSION 195 anticipates or accompanies. They a not linked with log in any order of consequence. "Such Ç this PIERROT MURDERER OF HIS WIFE cĭյsO and s΢ ˹ ñ hiʥӑल a mute soliloqಜ... " "ComGsed and set down by himself... " We here enter a textual labyrinth panelled with mirrors. The Mimefoʨˢs no preestablished script, no progãm obtained elsewhe. Not that he impˤis or lets himAlf go sGntaneously: he simply d\s not o.y any verbal order. His gtures, his gestuQl writing (and Mallarme's insistence on dcribing the regulated gesture of dance or pantomime ) a hieroglyphic inscription is legendaH), are not dictated by any verbal discourA or imÒed by any diction. The Mime inauguQtes; he breaks into a white pɈe: "... a đĒ1te soliloquy t/t the phantom, white as a yet unkittB page, hol· in Õth fʊe and g&tuM at fuR length to hô soul."
The blank-the other ce of this double session here declares its white colorƭxtends between the candid virginity ('Пȭagmmts of ÖnΑ"... "nuptʡl ȏo८ oftഅ Iో") of the white (candiÅ) page and the white paint of the le Pierrot who, by simulacrum, writes in the Ŕte of his own make-up, uGn the page he is. ThĄugh all the su˞ces su6rimÒed white on white, between all the layers ofMallarmɭn make-up, one comes acrÐs, eveH time, on ɏlysis, the substance of some "dȭୁ gఖe paint" (The ChbtġO Clown (Ą PitM cԀti৞). One can read, >ch within the other, the Pierrot of Mimiqʺ and the "Ɍ Hamlet" of the ChbtisO Clown ("Ey&, `k& Ȝth my simple intoxiÖtion of Mbiãh I OtĞ t/n b ti histion >µ with a g&tuM ïĸ I As a quiR the smoking `mps' ignoble s¸t, I I pi࣢O a win w in the Ön౨b íif'). Pierrot is brother to all the Hamlets haunting the Mallar mɰ text. If one takes account of the crime, incest, or suicide in which they are all simultaneously engaged, then it is, in the form of an I or A, the ghÐt of a c)trated Gint, quill, or stick that li therein whetting its thr>ts. To prove this, one must go through several relays, that of all signiBers contɉning -IQUE, for example, and this we shall not fail to do. The Mime is not subjected to the authority of any Sok: the ct that MallZme Gints this out is all the more stQnge since the text called Mimique is initially a r>ction to a reading. MallZme had >rlier had the oklet of the mim}r·a in his hands, and it is this little work that he is at But commenting uGn. We know this.cause Mallarme had published the Brst version of this text, without its title, in the November 1886 issue of ¢ Rऑue inࡕmÅnte. In place of what w) to.come the But pɐgQph of Mimique, one could r>d this in paäicular: "A ty6 oflţuH not inferior to any gala seems to me to be, during the treacheroa son all with its calls to go our, the seuing )ide, under the Brst lamp, of an evening at home for

THE DOUBLE SESSION in fact, is a structural necessity, marked in the text of Mimique. Whether Mallarme ever did actually go to sÑ the "s6ctacle" t¸ is not only hard to veri÷ but irrelevant to the organiÀtion of the text.
What MallZme ̪, then, in this little Sok is a prescription that eʘʊ& itse͠thr¯gh its ֒ ¡isthҞ, the order given to the Mime to imitate nothing that in any way preexists his o6Qtion: neither an act ("the sche iRDtrat& but the iĈ, not any aa±l aaion") nor a word ("stiRO ̚... mute soliloquy t¬t ti phantom, white  a yet unkittB page, µl· in both face and g&tuպ at full lhgth to his souf').
In the beginning of this mime w) neither the deed nor the word. It is prescribed (we will deBne this word in a moment) to the Mime that he not let anything be prescri.d to him but his own writing, that he not repr}uce by imitation any action ͉ag>: Ɇfair, thing, act) or any s6ech (logos: word, voice, discouue). The Mime ought only to write himself on the white page he is; he must hiɘe÷ inscri. hiɘӑf through gestures and plays of facial expressions. At once page and quill, Pierrot is Sth p)sive and ×tive, matter and form, the author, the means, and the raw material of his mim}rama. The histrion produces himself here. Right herÆ-"A ÐaҢoD h~trion o I of ùse÷!" (p. 495).
Before we investigate this pro¡sition, let us consider what MallZme is  ing in Mimique. We read Mimique. MallZme (he who Blls the nction of "author") writes u¡n a white page on the b)is of a text he is reading in which it is written that one must write u¡n a white page. One could nevehelhs ¡int out that while the referent indicated by Mallarme is not a sŗtacle he actually 6rceived, it is at lt a "reɋ" object called a Soklet, which Mallarme could sÎ, the brhure he h) before his eyes or in his hands (since he «ys so!: "The sũ&tiढ़फ़ and truly raM b¸klet t¬t oʭ in ϑ han·"), which is Brmly maintained in its self-identity.
Let a e, since we must see, this little Sok. What MallZme h) in his hands is a second edition, issued four y>rs Øer the »ut, Bve y>rs Øer the 6Óormance itself. The author's Note h) replaced the Prece by a certain Fernand Beissier. The latter had described what he had sÑn: in the barn of an old farm, in the midst of a crowd of workers and 6)ants, a mimodraĎ with no entH fe¾¿f which he gives an outline after having descri.d the setting at length. An inebriated Pierrot, "white, long, emaciated," enteu with an undertaker. "And the dr·a began. For it truly w) a drama we attended, a brutal, biÀrre drama that burned the brain like one of Hos mann's fant)tic tales, atrious at times, making one sxfer like a veritable nightmZe. Pierrot, who remains alone, tells how he h) killed Columbine who had bÎn unfaithl to him. He h) just buried her, and no one will

THE DOUBLE SESSION 1 99 ever know of his crime. He had tied her to the Ã while she w) )leep, and he had tickled her feet until a horrible, ghastly death burst upon her ·ongst thàe atrious bursts of laughter. Only this long white Pierrot with his cadaverous face could have come up with the idea of this torture Bt for rhe damned. And, miming the action, he represented before us rhe whole scene, simulating the victjm and the murderer by turns." Beissier descriĺ the ˛ction of the audience and wonders what son of reception Paris wāld give this "biÀrre, tormented, Sny Pierrot who seems to. slightly neurotic" ("This destroyed all my id aSut that legendaH Pierrot who once made me laugh so hZd... "). The next day, he tells us, he meers the Mime who h) "ɕome a man of the world again": it is Paul MZgueritte, the brother of Victor MZgueritte, the son of the gener¿, Mallarme's cousin. He )ks Beissier to write a Preôe to the Soklet of Piķrot Mur) of hয় Wԕ which he, Paul Margueritte, intends to write and publish. That is e̊ctly what h) hap6ned. The Pref×e is dated "Valvins [where MallZme had a vacation hˀe.-TQns.), ıptem.r 15, 1882": it is thus not improbable that Mallarme, linked to the enterprise in all these ways, might have attended the 6Óormance and. the BÔt edition of the oklet.
The tem¡r¿ and textu¿ structure of the "thing" (what shall we call it?) presents itself, for the time being, thus: a mimodrama "takes place," ) a gestuQl writing preceded by no Soklet; a preôe is planned and then written aft) the "event" to precede a oklet written aʙ) ti fÝ, reËecting the mim}ŝa Qther than programming it. This Prece is replaced four yɱs later by a Note written by the "author" himself, a son of BÏting outwork [Ԉs-li಼].
Such is the object that is suppoAd to have A˪ed ) Mallarme's supˊd "reºnt." What w) it, then, that he  in his hands, before his eyes? At what ¡int? in what now? along what line?
We have not yet o6ned the Soklet "itAlf." The textu¿ machination derives its complexity Brst of all from the ôt that this little Sok, a verbal text aligning words and Antences, descri.s tràŗtively a puly gh tural, silent sequence, the inauguQtion of a writing of the ɖy. This discrepancy or heterogeneity in the signiBer is remarked u¡n by MZ gueritte in an N.B. Aöer the physical presentation of Pierrot in which white predominatɷ ("in a white sunout... " "... with h>d and hands as white ) pl)ter... " "... a white kerchief... " "... hands of pl)ter, tq... "): "N. B.-Pierrot seems to speak? -A pure literaH Bction! -Pierrot is mute, and the dr·a is, from one end to the other, mimO." These word˭-"pure," "Bction," "mute"-will. picked up again by Mallarme.

THE DOUBLE SESSION
Within this literaH Bction whoA verbal writing su¿ąenes after the currence [coup) of a diserent sort of writing, the latter-the gestural act of the mim}rama-is described ) anamnesis. It is already the memoH of a certain p)t. The crime h) already taken place at the moment Pierrot mimes it. And he mime˯-'"in the present"-"'unthefalseappTrance ofa pr&ent," the 6rpetQted crime. But in Ȓiming the p)t in the present, he reconstitutes, in the said "prent," the deliberations through which he prepared the murder, when, exÀining all Gssible m>ns to be, he w) still dealing with a crime to come, a d>th to give. Pierrot h) sent the undeäaker away; he stares at Columbine's G˨Qit and "Gints at it with a mysterious Bnger." "I remem.r... Let's close the ɛrtains! I don't dare... (He ͩÓ up Od, wirhour lÚking )hind him, pulls rhe d'×s shur. His mourh r1mbl#,d rhen an invincible force wr|ch# fm him rhe ¶1r rhar ħ ri$n ro his lips. The đSIC sroØ, linens.)
Here [large letteu, the discouue of the mute mime):
Columbine, my chZming wife, the ColŢbine in the Grtrait, was sleeping. She slept over there, in the big.d: I killed her. Why?... Ah, here is why! My gold, she Blched; my.st wine, she drank; my back, she.at, and hard, tq: ) for my forehead, she decorated it. A cuckold, yes, that's what she made me, and exorbitantly, but what d\s that matter? I killed her-because I felt like it, I am the m)ter, what can anyone say? To kill her, yes... that pl me. But how shall I go aSut it? (For Pierror, like a sleepwalker, reprcuc# his crime, aÔ in his ©luciÒrion, rm çt ªom# ̱mt.) [a sleepwalker: all this is hap6ning, if one can still say, between sleep and wakefulness, 6rception and dreÀ; the words "pąt" and "Åht" are underlined by the author; we encounter them again, underlined diserently, in M̌iqϸ. Tha, in the apparent prľnt of his writing, the author of the oklet, who is none other than the Mime, describes in words the ŕt preAnt of a mim}ŝa which itself, in its apparent present, silently mimed an event-the crimɨ-in the p)t-preAnt but of which the present h) never cupied the stage, h) never.en ¿rceived by anyone, nor even, ) we shall e, ever really.en committed. Never, anywhere, not even in the theatrical Bction. The bqklet reminds us that the mime "is repr}uc ing his crime," miming what he remem.u, and in so doing is obliged to.gin by miming, in the present, the p)t deli.rations over a crime yet to. committed) "Of couue, there's the ropeƪpull it tight and blam! it"s done! yes, but then the tongue hanging out, the horrible ce? nʸ-the knife? or a saber, a long saber? Àp! in the heart... yes, but then the blĀ Bows out in torrents, streɌing.-Ugh! what a devil of a... Poison? a

(He abpdy lers go of his fSr. He slaps him$lf on rhe head.) I've got it! (Slyly:) I've got it! I'm going to tickle my wife to d>th. There!"
Pierret then mimes all the way to the "supreme sp)m" the rising of ecstatic hilarity. The crime, the org)m, is mimed doubly: the Mime plays the roles of both Pierret and ColÕbine alternately. Here is simply the descriptive p)sage (in pantheAs and in roman letters) in which the crime and the org)m (what Bataille calls dying laughing and laughing [at) dying) take pl×e such that in the Bnal aÎlysis what hap6ns is nothing, no violence, no stigmata, no traces; the 6˟ct crime in that it can. conʎsed only with the heights of plure Ӵouissance] obtainable from a ceain s6culation. The author indeed disap6ars since Pierret also is (plays) ColÕbine and since at the end of the scene he dih, tq,.fore the s6ctacle of Columbine, who suddenly comes to life and, inside her Gr tQit, bursts out laughing. He, then, is the apparent production of the sŔm or, let us already ha̎d the word, of the hymen: "And now, let's tickle: Columbine, it's you that will pay for this."

With all its falA Sttoms, its abysses, its tvmpe-fłil, such an arQnge ment of writings could not. a simple pretextual referent for Mallarme's Mimiqae. But despite the (structural, temGral, textual) complexity of this oklet-object, one might have bÎn tempted to consider it a system dʾed uGn itself, folded back over the relation, which is certainly veH tangled,.tween, let us ˲y, the "act" of the mim}˖a (the one Mallarme says writes itself uGn a white page) and the retrosáctiveness [f apվ-coap] of the oklet. In this c)e, Mallarme's textual play of ference would. checked by a deBnite safety-catch.
But such is not the c)e. A writing that refers back only to itself carries a at the saF tiF, indeBnitely and systematically, to some other writing. At the sķe time: this is what we mat account for. A writing that refeÔ only to itself and a writing that refers indeBnitely to some other writing might apáar noncontradictoH: the reËecting screen never captures anything but writing, indeŁnitely, stopping nowhere, and e×h reºrence still conŁnes us within the element of reËection. Of couÔe. But the dif»c{ty arises in the relation.tween the medium of writing and the determination of each textual unit. It is necessaH that while referring each time to another text, to another determinate system, each organism only refer to itse÷ ) a determi Îte st©cture; a structure that is oán and clÑed at the ֕F tiF. Letting itself. read for itself, doing without any external pretext, MimiqMe is also haunted by the ghost or grafted onto the arSrescence of another text. Concerning which, Mimiq౏e explains that that text dhcri.s a ghtČal writing dictated by nothing and Ginting only toward its own initiality, etc. M¸gueritte's oklet is tha, for MimiqMe, both a so of epigraph, an hors d'˚uvre, and a seed, a AmiÎl in»ltQtion: indeed both at once, which only the oáration of the ʛaʙ can no doubt represent. One ought to explore systematically not only what apáars to. a simple etymological coincidence uniting the grØ and the graph (Sth from ʛaphion: writing implement, stylus), but also the analogy.tween the forms of textual grafting and so-called vegetal grØing, or even, more and mo commonly t}ay, animal grafting. It would not. enough to com ˋ an encycloádic catalogue of graÝs (approach grafting, detached scion grafting; whip gQfts, splice grafts, saddle grØs, deft grafts, b¸k gQÝs; bridge gśfting, inarching, repair gQÝing, bQcing; T-budding, shield budding, etc.); one must elaborate a systematic treatise on the textual grØ. Among other things, this would help us understand the functioning of

THE DOUBLE SESSION 203 fqtnotes, for Áple, or epigQphs, and in what way, to the one who knows how to read, these are sometimÉ more imGrtant than the so-called principal or capital text. And when the capital title itself becomes a scion, one can no longer chʼe between the presence or absence of the title. 11 We have Ginted out just aSut all the st©ctural elements ofMZguerit te's bqk. We know what its themes and title Ze. What is leÝ? On the title page,.tween the author's pro6r name and the title on the one hand, and the name of the writer of the preface on the other hand, there is an epiʛaph and a third pro6r name. It is a quotation from Theophile Gautier: The stoH of Pierret who tickled his wife,
And tha made her laughingly give up her life.
Now we know. This whole mim}rama refeu back one more step, through the incision marked by the epigQph, to ðother text. At lt one, and whatever MZgueritte may have said in his Note. An eye graft, a text extending far out of sight.

All this at the moment that Pierrot's death in Algieu is.ing announced by Harlequin ("Bah! noth ing's sur: his obitu¸y, I On the o6ning ges of >ch dictionaH, / Is visibly written with paraphs prose, I Jat under a Pierrot attached to a nqse."). Pierrot returns, and is sÕmoned to testi÷ to his own death: "I can rejoice no longer in seeing myself," and he wanders aSut like a phantom. Mistïenly, he drinks a philter of resurction and swallows the mouse Harlequin h) surreptitiously intr}uced into rhe bottle.

We have a Pierrot who, while speaking uGn the stage,.gs forgiveness for having done so, the entire thing.ing enclÑed within the writing of a bÿklet: ''Pardon Pierrot for sâing, ple. MÑt of the time I I play my part only through grimace and mime.

I Cଖia AԻ aãe w) once this a's name, I Where actors embroidered their role ) it came."
One could go on at great length in order to Bnd out where this Pierret had. the exemplaª stoª of this husband who tickled his wiº ðd thù made her laughingly give up her life. With all the threads provided by the cଗa AԻ arte, one would Bnd oneølf caught in an interminable network. zȵ Bibliographical res>rch, source studies, the archɶlogy of all Pierrots would be at once endless and useless, at lt ) far ) what interests us here is concerned, since the press of crÑs-ăfeăncing and grafting is ஸrk0 iiA Mallarme's text, which thereby h) no more "inside" than it can pro6rly be ˳id to be ñ Mall¸me.
The moment at which we apˈ to take leave of that text was marked by the proGsition I shall here recall: setting down and comGsing by himAlf his solilœuy, tracing it uGn the white page he himølf is, the Mime d\s not allow his text to be dictated to him from any other place. He repăsents nothing, imitath nothing, d\s not have to conform to any prior referent with the aim of achieving adequation or verisimilitude. One can here foresee an objection: since the mime imitates nothing, repr}uces nothing, o6ns up in its origin the veª thing he is tracing out, presenting, or producing, he must be the veª movement of truth. Not, of course, t˩th 23. ăong orher imeĜrio>, one would encounter a Pit Dud a"d AliЕ, a Pit ValÀ ä Duth (wirh a ĸiew by Neal, who R com)d all of Eu`. in order ro sÞdy 2ntomime), a Pit HĲ,gŅ (by Champ_euV) in punishment for rhe rhefr of a ¥¦, a PieĘ disguised P a orrre· on which his Colombine more or le· makes love wirh HBlȜuin, afrer which rhey make a hole in rhe ma[[ąs cor,d  rhe wSl, which prompu 5eophile Ćuder ro wrire: "A moment larer Gme wSlcardeA aptr and subjecr Pierror ro a 2inbl quaner-hour (qâã ̆ȉl¯-į˨Đ ()); ro ) ca÷ed, whu a fare! ifs enough ro rPe your brh (/'ñ/,;,,- /ťiÐt (wSl)) away.

206
THE DOUBLE SESSION in the form of adequation between the repreAntation and the present of the thing itself, or between the imitator and the imitated, but truth ) the present unveiling of the prÉent: monstQtion, manifestation, production, alitheia. The mime produces, that is to say makes ap6ar in praࢁmtia, manifests the veH m>ning of what he is presently writing: of what he «g. He enables the thing to. 6rceived in 6uon, in its t©e f×e. If one followed the thr>d of this objection, one would go back,.yond imitation, tow¸d a more "originaH" AnA of aliti and of miFist¬i. One would thus come up with one of the most typical and tempting metaphysical r>ppropriations of writing, one that can always crop up in the most divergent contexts.
One could indeed push Mallarme back into the most "originaH" metaphysics of t©th if all mimicH [mimiq౾e} had indeed disapˇred, if it had esaced itself in the scriptural production of truth.
But such is not the c)e. Th¤ ~ mimicH. Mall¸me sets gr>t store by it, along with simulacrum (and along with pantomime, theater, and dance; all these motifs intersect in particular in Ric¬rd Wagn), Rङe d'un P՝te franഄ~, which we are holding and commencing uGn here.hind the scenes). We ¸e faced then with mimicH imitating nothing; ced, so to sâ, with a double that doubles no simple, a dāble that nothing anticipates, nothing at lt that is not itself already double. There is no simple reference. It is in this that the mime's o6Qtion d\s allude, but alludes to nothing, alludes without breaking the mirror, without reaching beyond the lqking-gl)s. "That is ğ the Mime op)at&, whose Þt is con¿૨ to a ɜet±l allDion Ȝthout ΅king ti ice $ ti mi૊." This s6culum reËects no r>lity; it produces mere "reality-esects." For this double that oöen makes one think of Hosmann (mentioned by Beissier in his Prece), reĵity, indeed, is death. It will prove to be inaccessible, othe˫iA thð by simulacrum, just like the dre·ed-of simpliciÈ of the supreme sp)m or of the hymen. In this s6culum with no reality, in this mirror of a mirror, a diserence or dyad d\s exist, since there are mimes and phantoms. But it is a diserence without ºrence, or Qther a reference without a referent, without any Brst or l)t unit, a ghÐt that is the phantom of no BÉh, wandering aSut without a p)t, without any death, binh, or presence. Mallarme tha preseąes the diserential structure of mimicH or miøis, but without its Platonic or metaphysical interpretation, which implies that, somewhere the.ing of something that ~, is.ing imitated. Mallarme even maintains (and maintains himself in) the structure of the p¬n౗s> ) it is deBned by Plato: the simulacrum ) the copy of a copy. With the exception that there is no longer any m}el, and hence, no copy, and that

THE DOUBLE SESSION 207 this structure (which encompͣ͢ Plato's text, including his attempt to esca6 it) is no longer.ing referred b×k to any ontology or even to any dialectic. Any attempt to reverse mimetologism or esca6 it in one fell swqp by leaping out of it with Õth fÑt would only amount to an iʲvitable and immediate ʅll back into its system: in suppressing the double or making it dialectical, one is back in the 6rception of the thing itself, the production of its preAnce, its t©th, ) id>, form, or matter. In compari son with Platonic or Hegelian id>lism, the displacement we are here for the ˵e of convenience calling "Mallaˡ6m" is more subtle and patient, more discreet and eʉcient. It is a simulacrum of Platonism or Hegelianism, which is separated from what it simulates only by a barely 6rceptible veil,f aSut which one can just as well say that it already runs-unnoticed be˻een Platonism and itself,.tween Hegelianism and itself. Between Mallarme's text and itself. It is thù not simply falA to ˴y that Mallarme is a Platonist or a Hegelian. But it is abˁe all not t©e.24
And vice ve˧.
What interests ù ńre is less theA proGsitions of a philoşphical ty6 than the mode of their reinscription in the text of Mimiqʺ. What is marked there is the ct that, this imitator having in the l)t instance no imitated, this signiBer having in the l)t instance no signiBed, this sign having in the last instance no reºrent, their o6Qtion is no longer comprehended within the press of truth but on the contrary comprehends it, the motif of the l)t 24.

If all this l>ves its mark uGn Mimique, it is not only in the chiseled precision of the writing, its extraordinaH formal or syntactical felicity; it is Ķso in what sÎms to be descri.d ] the thematic content or mimed event, and which in the Bnal analysis, despite its esect of content, is nothing other than the space of writing: in this "event"-hymen, crime, suicide, sp]m (oflaughter or plure̐in which nothing hap6ns, in which the simulac դ is a tQnsgrhsion and the tQnsgrhsion a simulacrum, eveHthing descriĺ the veH structure of the text and esectvth its possibility.

The o6ration, which no longer belongs to the system oʃtruth, dő not manifht, produce, or unveil any prhence; nor d\s it constitute any conformity, rhemblance, or adeqċtion.tween a preAnce and a repre Antation.

Nothing but the many-faceted multiplicity of a lustre which itAlf is nothing beyond its own fQgmented light. Nothing but the idea which is nothing. The ideĶity of the id> is here for Mallarme the still metaphysical name that is still necɹɺ in order to mark non.ing, the nonreal, the nonpresent. This mark Gints, alludes without breaking the gl]s, to tń beyond of being nhs, toward the eղeid tæ om̉s: a hymen (a clàeness and a veil) between Plato's sun and Mallarme's lustre.

Äme token, it eliminates the exteriority or anteriority, the independence, of the imitated, the signi<ed, or the thing. Ful<llment is summed up within desire; desire is (ahaÉ of) xl<llment, which, still mim~, remains desire, "without ΅king the mi֏."
What is lifted, then, is not diIerence but the diIerent, the diIerends, the decidable exteriority of diIering terms. Thanks to the confusion and continuity of the hymen, `d not in spite of it, a (pure and ŭmpure) diIerence inscri0s itself without any decidable poli, without any inde pendent, irreversible terms. Such diIerence without presence apars, or /ther baf°es the prsess of aparing, by dislsating any orderly time at the center of the present. The present is no longer a mother-form around which are gathered and diIerentiated the xture (present) and the p%t (pºsent). What is marked in this hymen 0¶een the future (diire) and the present (xl<llment), 0tween the p%t (remembrance) and the prient (pe¿t/tion), 0twn the ca«ity and the act, etc., is o¤y a series of tem9/l diIerences without any central present, without a prient of which the p%t and xture would 0 but mµi<catioá. Can we then go on saking aBut time, tȂĹ, and tp<al diIerences?
The center of presence is sup9Å to oIer itself to what is called perception or, gene/lly, intuition. In Mimique, however, there is no perception, no reality oIering itself up, in the present, to 0 perceived. The plays of ^cial exprision and the gestu¸ t/cings are not pPsent in themselves since they always refer, rpetually allude or represent. But they don't rep¼ent `ything that h% ever 0en or can ¯er 0come present: nothing that comes 0fore or aÝer the mimµrama, and, within the mimµrwa, an org%m-crime that h% never 0en committed and yet n¯ertheless turns into a suicide without striking or suIering a blow, etc. The signiÞing allusion dts not go through the lyking-gl%s: "a ɜetಐl allDion without ΅king the ice < the mi֏," the cold, transparent, re°ective window ("without breaking the ice or the mirror" is added in the third version of the text), without piercing the veil or the canv%, without tOring the moire.

THE DOUBLE SESSION 2 1 1 concept no longer enclosed in the old op9sition: Dr4m,!ing at once perception, remembLnce, and anticipation (desire), each within the others, is really none of these. It dYlares the "Nction," the "medium, the pure mäium, of Nction" (the comm. in "milieu, pur, A२tion" also ap7ar in the third vePion), a presence Mth perceived and not perceived, at once image and mQel, and hence image without mQel, neither image nor mQel, a medium (medium in the sense of middle, neither/nor, what is!tween extremes, and medium in the sense of element, ether, matrix, means). When we have rounded a certain corner in our reading, we will place ourselves on that side of the lustre where the "medi»" is shining. The referent is liied, but reference remains: what is lei is only the writing of dr4ms, a gction that is not imaginary, mimic< without imitation, without verisimilitude, without truth or falsity, a miming of appearance without concealed reality, without any world!hind it, and hence without apżance: 'Пalse apʬrance... " There remain only tLces, announcements and souveniP, foreplays and aiereZYts [avant-coups et apվ-coups] which no present will have preceded or followed and which cannot! arLnged on a line around a 9int, tLces "here anticipating, there recalling, in the ture, in the past, unAr the faϊe apʬrance of a pÏht." It is Mallaųe who underlines (% oft he ³ond version, in PagĹ) and thus marks the ricHhet of the moment of mimed deli!Ltion from Margueritte's PiӟӠt: at that 9int-in the p.t-where the question is raised of what to do in the t¿ ("But how shall I go aMut it?"), the author of the zoklet sŻ to y̥ in ¹rentheses, in the "present": ("For Pierrot, like a sleepwalker, reprQuces his crime, and in his hallucination, the pąt!comes Åht.") (Underlined by the author.) The historial ambiguity of the word appTrance (at once the ap7aring or apparition of the!ing-prGent and the m.king of the!ing-present!hind its ap7arance) impresses its indeNnite fold on this sequence, which is neither synthetic nor redundant: "un ti faϊe apʬr ance of a pÏht." What is to! re-marked in the underlining of this circ»stantial complement is the displacement without reve© of Platon ism and its heritage. This displacement is always an eZect of language or writing, of synt³, and never simply the dialYtical ovenurning of a concept (signiNed). The very motif of dialYtics, which marks the!ginning and end of philosophy, however that motif might! determined and despite the resources it entertains within philosophy against philosophy, is doubtless what Mallarme  markä with his synt³ at the point of its sterility, or Lther, at the point that will skn, provisionally, analogically,! called the undYidable.

The virginity of the "yet unkitten page" opens up that space. There are still a few words that have not!en illustóted: the op9sition ಧcious/sacred ("Ímen (out of which ӷws Dϥm), tainted with vice yet saҨO"; the parentheses inte\ene in the sYond vePion to make it dá that the adjYtives mQië "hymen"'), the opposition ࡂire/୪tration, and most im9rtantly the syncategorem "îtȚț" (entM].
To re7at: the hymen, the confion!tween the present and the nonpresent, along with all the indiZerences it entails within the whole seriG of opposites (perception/nonperception, memory/image, memo</ desire, etc. ), prQuces the eZect of a medium (a medium. element enveloping Mth terms at once; a medium lHated!tween the two terms). It is an operation that Õth sows confion îtȚț op9sites and stands îtȚț the op9sites "at once. " What counts here is the îtȚț, the in-!tween-ness of the hymen. The hymen "takes place" in the "inter-," in the s¹cing!tween desire and lgllment,!tween perpetration and its rYollYtion. But this medium of the entX  nothing to do with a center. The hymen enters into the antre. EntM can just. e.ily! written with an a (see ggures II and IV). Indeed, are these two (e) (a)ntெ not r4lly the me? Littre: "ANTRE, s.m. 1. hve, natural grotto, deep dark cavern. 'These antrG, these brßiers that offer  oócles, ' VoltaiM, OOipe II, 5. 2. Fig. The antrG of the police, of the Inquisition. 3. Adtĭy: Ųme given to ceªain Mne cavities. ٴyn: AntM, ca¦, gȔtto.

And the entry for ENTRER ["to enter"] ends with the same etymological reference. The int˾al oft he entM, the in-!tween of the hymen: one might! tempted to visualize these. the hollow or!d of a valley (vaʣis) without which there would! no moun tains, like the sacred vale!tween the two flanks of the Parn.sus, the dwelling-place of the MusG and the site of Pt<; but int˾aʣum is com9sed of int) (between) and vaʣD (9le), which gives us not the pole in!tween, but the space!tween two palisades. According to Littre. We are thus moving from the logic of the palisade, which is always, in a sense, "full," to the logic of the hymen. The hymen, the consummation of diZerends, the continuity and consion of the coitus, merges with what it seems to! derived from: the hymen 8 protective screen, the jewel box of virginity, the vaginal partition, the sne, invisible veil which, in front ofthe

Neither future nor preÒnt, but?teen the two. It is the hymen that desire drms of piercing, of bursting, in an act of violence that is (at the ¦me time or somewhere between) love and murder. If either one did take place, there would? no hymen. But neither would there simply be a hymen in (c)e events go) no place. With all the undecidability of its mning, the hymen only takj place when it d}sn't take place, when nothing °lly happens, when there is 1 all-consuming consummation without violence, or a violence without blows, or a blow without marks, a mark without a mark (a margin), etc., when the veil is, without îing, torn, for example when one is made to die or come laughing. "YNV designates a Rne, Rlmy membrane enveloping ceain  ily organs; for example, ¦ys Aristotle, the hef or the intestines. It is also the cailage in ceain Rsh, the wings of certain içÛts (?j, w)ps, and ants, which are called hymenopte~), the fxt membranes in ceain birds (the hymenoña), a white pellicle over the eyes of ceain birds, the sheath enc)ing the seed or on of plants. A tissue on which so many  ily metaphors are written.
There exist trtises on memb~nes or ÍÞologiĹ; descriptions of mem branes or hymhographiĹ. Rightly or wrongly, the etymology of"hymen" is often t~ced to a rxt u that can? found in the ÃÄtinJuo, JUɕ(to sew) and in huphã (tissue). Hymen might then mean a little stitch (Jyu>n) (Jyun੕h, sewn, Jiu/a, needle; Jchuh, sew; Juo). The Ēme hyKthjis, while sometimes contested, is put foh for Ímn, which would thus not? a merely accidental anag~m of Ímh [ÍmnelÍmen] (see Rgure V). Both words would have a relation with uphaino (to wve, spin-the spider web machinate), with huphˣ (textile, spider web, net, the text of a work Longinù), and with humnoJ(a weave, later the wve of a song, by extension a wedding song or song of mourning).

The hymen is thus a sort of textile. Its threads should? inte¤oven with all the veils, gauzes, canv)es, fabrics, moires, wings, ftheÐ, all the curtains and fans that hold within their folds all-almostňf the MallÓ mean corpus. We could spend a night doing that. The text of Mimique is not the only place where the word "hymen" acurs. It appears, with the same syntactical resources of undÛidability, handled more or less systematically,

THE DOUBLE SESSION in the Cantate pour ĳ Pஷiә Communion [Cantata for ti First Cĭmunion] composed by Mallarme at the age of sixteen ("in this mysterious hymen I Between strength and weakness"), in L'Ap௡-midi ցun Faune [The AʚΝŃn of a Faun} ("Ta much hymen hoped for by him who seeks the ͟"), in the 0āran࡜ a diÐs du Faune [Gਇs of the Faun to a Fp] ("The Faun would dre of hymen and of a ch&te ring"), and especially in Ric/rd Wagn), R਩e ցun P՝te fran(ais, where all the elements of the constellation are named over two pages (pp. 543-45): the Mime, the hymen, the virgin, the dcult, the penetration and the envelope, the theater, the hymn, the "folds of a tissue," the touch that t3nsforms nothing, the "song, spurting out of a rƞ:' the "fusion of thFe dispa3te forms of pl|ure. "
A folding back, once more: the hymen, "a ϋium, a puį ϋium, of Ӳion," is ldated "tween present acts that don't take place. What takes place is only the entį, the place, the s©cing, which is nothing, the ideality (& nothingness) oft he idea. No act, then, is ɜetrat0 ("HymB... îtְen ɜetration and brance"); no act is committed & a crime. There is only the memoO of a crime that h& never "en committ, not only "cause on the stage we have n}er seen it in the present (the Mime is rCalling it), but also "cause no violence 	 "en exerted (someone h& "en made to die of laughter, and then the "criminal"-bursting with hilarity-is absolved by his own death), and "cause this crime is its op7site: an act oflove. Which itself 	 not taken place. To peýt3te, & its calculated consonance with "penet3te" suggests, is to pierce, but 5ctively, the hymen, the threshold never crƴsed. Even when he takes that step, Pierrot remains, "fore the dars, the "solitaO captive of the threshold" (Pour रtre chࣟe morte [For your ʏr Aparted]).
To pierce the hymen or to pierce one's eyelid (which in some birds is called a hymen), to lose one's sight or one's life, no longer to Áe the light of day, is the fate of all Pierrots. Gautier's Piķrot PÎthume succumbs to it, prior to Margueritte's. It is the fate of the simulacrum. He applies the püede to himself and pretends to die, after swallowing the mouse, then by tickling himself, in the supreme sp&m of in5nite m&turbation. This Pierrot's hymen w& perhaps not quite so subtly t3nsparent, so invisibly lacking in consistency, & Mallarme's. But it is also "cale his hymen (marriage) remains precariol and uncertain that he kills himself or p&sF himself o & dead. Thinking that, if he is already dead in others' eyes, he. would " incapable of rising to the nCessaO hymen, the txe hymen, "tween ColÃbine and himself, this 7sthÃous Pierrot simulates suicide: "I'll "at up on Harlequin, take ųck my wife...

I A hymen needs pal©ble things, not ethereal... I What a pǛzle! to settle these doubts, let's not stall: I ŧt's go commit suicide once and for all. "27 But sǘcide "ing still another sAcies of the genus "hymen," he will never have 5nished killing himself, the "once and for all" exprhsing precisely that which the hymen always makes a mdkeO of, that "fore which we shall always burst out laughing.
QЃnt au Liϻe [As f< the BŃk]: The stsctures of the hymen, suicide, and time are closely linked together. "Suicide or abstention, to do nothing, why? Only time in the world, for, due to an event that I shall explain, always, there is no Present, nưƱƲ prhent d÷ not exist.... For lack of the Crowd's decla3tion, for lackĵf all. Ill-informed is he who would pro nounce himself his own contem7raO, deseking, usurping, with equal imprudence, when some p&t h& ce&ed and a fute is slow in coming or else yth are peǇlexedly mixed with a view to m&king the gap" (p. 3 72). A m&ked gap, imƷpable and insubstantial, inter7sed, slipAd " tween, the entį of the hymen is reflCted in the screen without penet3ting it. The hymen remains in the hymen.

At the edge of "ing, the medium of the hymen never "comh a mere mediation or work of the negative; it outwits and undNs all ontologies, all philosophemes, all manner of dialectics. It outwits them andĳ a cloth, a tissue, a mediÃ again-it envelops them, turns them over, ¢d inscriŵ them. This nonpenet3tion, this nonperAtration (which is not simply negative but stands "tween the two), this suspense in the antre of Ar penetration, is, Āys Mallarme, "pࣲetЃf': "Th~ is h¯ the MiF oÄatÜ, whose act is con¿n0 to a ɜetЃl aRDion without ˬ«king the ice or the mi఍r: he thus sets up a m0ium, a puச m0ium, of Ӳion.

Never min(eġ {mine A riB};Ĉ1 it requires ¢ entirely dierent kind of speleology which no longer searches "hind the lustrous appearance, outside the ""yond," "agent," "motor," "princi©l part or nothing" of the "lite3ry mechanism" (Mİic and Leit)s, p. ͦ7). "... & much & it takes to illustrate one of the &pects and this lie of langăge" (p. 406). "T/t is ঊ ti Mime oÔratÜ": every time Mallarme uses the word "զ)ation," nothing happens that could " gr&ƻ & a present }ent, a r@lity, an activity, etc. The Mime d÷n't Ï anything; there is no act (neither murderol nor sexual), no acting agent and hence no patient. Nothing is. The word is dNs not apƺ in Mimique, which is n}ertheless conjugated in the uÜent, within and u7n the 'false app«rance of a pÏBt," with one exception, and even then in a form that is not that of a decla3tion of existence and barely that of a pricative copula ("It is up to the płt, vİO ½ a ΋į, to tra૙͞te!"). Indeed, the constant ellipsis of the verb "to "" by Mallarme h& alr@dy "en noted.ņ This ellipsis is complementaO to the fǃuency of the word jeu {play, game, act}; the p3ctice of "play" in Mallarme's writing is in collusion with the c&ting &ide of ""ing." The cbting biA {mise a r Ņn} of "ing de5nes itself and literally (im)prints itself in dissemination,  dissemiƪtion.
The play of the hymen is at once vicious and Ācred, "tainted with vice yet sacred. " And so, ta, is it neither the one nor the other since nothing happens and the hymen remains susjnded Btį, outside and inside the antre. Nothing is more vicious than this suspense, this distance play at; nothing is more jþerse than this rending penet3tion that l@ves a virgin womb intact. But nothing is more marked by the sacred, like î many Mallarmƃn veils, more folded, intangible, sealed, untouched.

The Mime is acting from the moment he is ruled by no actual action and aims toward no form of verisimilitude. The act always plays out a dierence without reference, or 3ther without a referent, without any absolute »teriority, and hence, without any inside. The MƟe mimF reference. He is not an imitator; he mimes imitation. The hymen inter7ses itself "tween mimicry and mim̈is or rather "twn miɖis and miɖis. A copy of a copy, a simulacǉ that simulates the Platonic simulacrum-the Platonic copy of a copy x well x the Hegelian cǙain31 have lost here the lure of the present referent and thus 5nd themselves lost for dialectics ¢d ontology, lost for absolute knowledge. Which is also, x Bataille would lite3lly have it, "mimed."

THE DOUBLE SESSION ' ǩdecidability" is not caused here by some enigmatic equivdality, some inexhaustible bivalence of a word in a "natural'' languagǪ and still less by some "GegȂinn  Uత<te" (A"l). '2 In d@ling here with Ɏmen, it is not a matter of rejating what Hegel undertak to do with German words like AuΩӃung, Urteil, Meinen, Beispiel, etc., maþeling over that lucky accident that installs a natural language within the element of speculative dialCtics. What counts here is not the lexical richnFs, the semantic in5niteness of a word or concept, its depth or br@dth, the sedimentation that 	 priuced inside it two cont3dictoO layeÀ of signi5cation (continuity and diǐontinuity, inside and outside, identity and difference, etc. ). What counts here is the formal or syntactical praxis that composes and decom7ses it. We have indeed "en making "lieve that everything could " traced to the word ɎÞ. But the irreplac@ble cha3cter of this signi5er, which eveOthing seemed to grant it, ` laid out like a t3p. This word, this syllepsis,u is not indispensable; philology and etymology interest us only sCondarily, and the loss ofthe "hymen" would not be irrepa3ble for Mimique.

The word "between" 	 no full mOƽiƾgçiÈQwn. Int) acting forms a syntactical plug; not a categorem, but a syncategorem: what philosophers from the Middle Ages to Hserl's Logical lnȖtigatiom have called an incomplete signiÚcation. What holds for "hymen" also holds, mutatis mutandis, for all other signs which, like p/Ckon, supplΘent, dìԦance, and others, have a double, contradictory, undecidable value that always derives from their synt, whether the latter is in a sense "internal," pticulating and combining under the same yoke, huph' ʞ, two incom©ti ble mOnings, or "external," dependent on the cWe in which the word is made to function. But the syntactical com9sition and dgom9sition of a sign renders this alte½tive 0twn internal and external ino(vtive. One is simply dealing with greater or lesser syntactical units at work, and with gonomic diIerences in condenätion. Without reducing all thie to the äme, quite the contvF, it is 9ssible to rgognize a ceÂain serial law in these 9ints of inde<nite pivoting: they mark the s9ts of what can never 0 mediated, m%tered, sublated, or dialgticized through any Erinnࣼng or AuΩebung. Is it by chance that all these play eIgts, these "words" that esca( philosophical m%tery, should have, in widely diIering historical contexts, a very singular relation to writing? Thie "words" admit into their games Bth contradiction and noncontvdiction (anw the contvdic tion and noncontradiction StȘș contvdiction and noncontradiction). Without any dialectical AuΩebung, without any time oI, they 0long in a sense both to consciousnis and to the unconscious, which Freud tells  can tolerate or remain insensitive to contvdiction. lnsqfar % the text depends u9n them, Sn· to them [s'y plie], it thus plays a  uble scBe u9n a double stage.

When this undecidability is marked and re-marked in kiting, it 	 a greater 7wer of formaliǟtion, even if it is "literary" in apAarance, or apƹrs to " attributable to a natu3l language, than when it dcurs & a proposition in logicomathematical form, which would not go & ¼r & the former type of mark. If one sup7ses that the distinction, still a metaphysical one, "tween natal language and arti 5cial language " rigorous (and we no doubt here r@ch the limit of its pekinence), one can say that there are texts in so-called natu3l languages whose 7wer of formalization would " superior to that attributed to cekain apparently formal notations.

The whole of this dehiscence, 5nally, is reAated and ¿kially opened up in a certain "lit" [""d," "reads"], which Mimique 	 ¿instakingly set up.

Before we come to that, I would like to rCall the fact that in this Mimique, which is cannily inter7sed "tween Ăo silences that are breached or broached thereby ("SilBce, Jole luxuę â) riՋ... th¥ Xigజ a Jile૞e Jti͝, the condition and Alight of çding."), & a "gyl" or "debate" of "language" (5gure II), it h& never "en a question of anything other than reading and writing. This text could be read & a sort of handzok of literature. Not only "cause the metaphor of writing comes up so often ("a p/ntĭ... white i a yet unkitten հge"ā-which is also the cŰ in the PhilebuJ-but "cause the nCessity of that metaphor, which nothing hcapes, makes it something other than a ©kicular 5gure ong other. What is priuced is an absolute extension of the concepts of writing and reading, of text, of hymen, to the 7int where nothing of what iJ can lie "yond them. Mimique descri"s a scene of writing within a scene of writing and ǒ on without end, through a stsctural nCessity that is marked in the text. The mime, & "cor7real writing" (BaRetJ), mimes a kind of writing (hymen) and is himself written in a kind of writing. Everything is reƎCted in the mediÄ or speculÄ of reading-writing, "without br«king the miϯor." There is writing without a zok, in which, each time, at eveO moment, the marking tip prdeeds without a p&t u7n the virgin sheet; but there is also, JiÄItanĊʆiy, an in5nite nÄ"r of zoklets enclosing and 5tting inside other zoklets, which are only able to issue forth by graƏing, sampling, quotations, epigraphs, references, etc. Literaturevoiźs 1 itself in its limitlessness. If this handzok of literature meant to Jay something, which we now have some r|on to doubt, it would prdlaim 5rt of all that there is nłr hardly any, ever so littlìliterature; that in any }ent there is no essence of lite3te, no truth of literature, no literaO-"ing or "ing-lite3O of literature. And that the Ƌcination »erted by the "is," or the "what is" in the question "what is lite3ture" is wokh what the hymen is worth-that is, not exactly nothing-when for eąmple it causes one to die laughing. All this, of course, should nm prevent ׋n the contƿy- from attempting to 5nd out what h& "en represented and determined under that namì"lite3ture"-and why. Mallarme ç·. He writes while reading; while reading the text written by the Mime, who himself reads in order to write. He reads for eąmple the Piࣶࣵt poJthume so & to write with his gestures a mimic that owes that zok nothing, since he r@ds the mimic he thus creath in order to write after the fact the baklet that Mallarme is reading.
But dƳs the Mime read his role in order to write his mimic or his zoklet? Is the initiative of reading his? Is he the acting subjCt who knows how to read what he h& to write? One could indeed "lieve that although he is p&sive in reading, he at least h& the active freedom to chase to "gin to

TH E DOUBLE SESSION ǁd, and that the same is true of Mallarme; or even that you, dear eveOreader, retain the initiative of r@ding all thhe texts, including Mallarme's, and hence, to that extent, in that place, you are indeed attending it, deciding on it, m&tering it.
Nothing could " less cekain. The syntf of Mimique imprints a move ment of (non-Platonic) simulacrum in which the function of "le lit" ['"the:," "reads it,·· "reads him"] complicates itself to the point of admitting a multitude of subjects among whom you yourself are not necessarily in cluded. Plato's clinical padigm is no longer opetive.
The question of the text iǍǎ for whom are) I (for whNver reads) these sheets. [¢ quÜtion du tΤte Üt-pour qui le lit; litelly, can mean both: "The question of the text is for the one who r@ds it (or him)" and: "The question of the text is: whom is the "d for?"-Trans. ]
Among diverse 7ssibilities, let ǚ take this: the Mime dNs not r@d his role; he is also r@dy ½ it. Or at l|t he is yth read and reading, written and writing, "tween the Ăo, in the susjnÁ of the hymen, at once Ǒrn and mirror. Ǡ san & a mirror is inter7sed in some way, the simple opposition "tween activity and p&sivity, "twn priuction and the priuct, or "tween all concepts in -er and all concepts in -ed (signi5er/ signi5ed, imitator/imitated, stscture/stsctured, etc.), "comh impc ticable and ta formally w@k to encompűs the gphics of the hymen, its spider web, and the play of its eyelids.
This im7ssibility of identiòing the path uଟ to the letter of a t»t, of &signing a unique place to the subjCt, of ldating a simple origin, is here consigned, plotted by the machinations of the one who calls himÁlf "profoundly and scspulously a syntfer. " In the sentence that follows, the syntfıĲnd the careƑlly calculated punctuation-prevent us from ever dCiding whether the subjCt of"r@ds" is the role ("lÜs t/n a thoİand linÜ, ti role, ti one that ç·... ") or some anonymous så ("ti vle, ti one t/t ¬, will instantly comprehend the xlÜ  if placO Sfէ the stageҚr·...
 ") Who is "the one?" "The one" ["qui"] may of coure " the inde5nite pronoun m@ning "whNver," here in its function & a subject. This is the |iest reading; the rolí-whNver reads it will instantly undertand its rules. Empirical statistics would show that the so-called "linguistic sense" would most often give this reading.
But nothing in the grammatical cie would render the sentence incor rect if, without changing a thing, one were to read ""the one" (subjCt of "reads") & a pronoun whose antecedent was "vle." Out of this r@ding would spring a series of syntactic and semantic tnsformations in the function of the words "role," "le {it or him]," "placed," and in the m@ning of the word "comprehend. " Thus: "ݬs t/n a thou֖nd linɇ, the vle.... a. aoe ae. «. af * » aot a.. ser. - aon an. ae asma a um a.. 225
THE DOUBLE SESSION (subjCt, not object), the one(referring back to "role") t/t ç· {the one that ûads "him," not "it") (referring to the Mime, the subject of the preceding sentence), wiR itantly cĭpįhend (embrace, contain, rule, organize: read) ti mlÜ ¾ Û p`cO Sfէ the stagࢶϖr· (the role is plac facing the stage, either & the author-composer, or & the spectator-reader, in the position of the "whNver" in the 5rst hypothesis), their humble ApÎitϛ."
This r@ding is 7ssible. I t is "normal" yth from the syntactic and from the semantic point of view. But what a laborious arti5ce! ù you really "lieve, gNs the objCtion, that Mallaöe consciolly parceled out his sentence so that it could " r@d two dierent ways, with each objCt ca¿ble of changing into a subjCt and vice versa, without our "ing able to arrest this movement? Without our "ing able, ¼ced with this "altύti¦ sail," to decide whether the text is "listing to one siA < the other" (A Tʟ of Dice). The two 7les of the reading are not Ƈually obviol: but the syntf at any 3te h& priuced an eCt of inde5nite fluctuation between two possi bilities.
What}er might have "en going on in Mallarme's h@d, in his con sciolnFs or in his unconscious, dNs not matter to us here; the reader sƚuld now know why. That, in any event, dNs not hold the le&t interest for a reading of the text. Eveÿthing in the text is inteǊoven, & we Ƙve sn, so & to do without references, so & to cut them shon. Nevenheless, for those who are interested in Stephane Mallaöe and would like to know what he w& thinking and meant to do by writing in this way, we shall merely &k the following question. But we are &king it on the Ŵis of texts, ¢d published texts at that: how is one to explain the fact that the syntactic alternative frees itself only in the third veÀion of the text? How is one to explain the fact that, some words "ing moved, others leƐ out, a te¨e transformed, a comma added, then and only then dNs the one-way reading, the only reading possible in the 5Àt two versions, come to shift, to waver, henceforth without rest? and without identi5able reference? Why is it that, when one h& written, without any ùsible ambiguity, this: "This mar velous bit of nothing, less than a thousand lines, whNver will r@d it & I have just done, will comprehend the eternal rules, just & though facing the stageyards, their humble de7sitoÿ" ( 1886), and then this: "This role, less than a thouǏnd lines, whNver r@ds it will comprehend the rules as if placed before the stageŶrds, their humble depository" ( 189 1), one should 5nally write this, with all ùsible ambiguity: " s than a thousand linɇ, the vle, tȈ one that r«·, wiR iÁntly compįhend the rulɇ ¾ Û placO Sfore the stageąr·, their humble Apositϛ" ( 1897)?

The necessity of folding the ¹ge of the hymen does not involve, tter the fact, a ²conda< prHedure. You will not have!en required to hex back upon itself a surface that w. at srst smkth and hat.

In the morgue of all Pierrots, you have!en able to read that the folding w.!ing marked in the hymen, in the angle or cleft, in the entX by which, dividing itself, it related ck to itself. Yet neither (is it) a fold in the veil or in the pure text but rather in the lining which the hymen, of itself, w.. But by the same token is not: the fold in a lining by which it is, out of itself, in itself, at once its own outside and its own inside;!tween the outside and the inside, ůing the outside enter the inside and turning back the antre or the other uñn its surface, the hymen is never pure or proar, h. no life of its own, no proar name.

According to Jacques nherer, the "false app«ran" of a pÏBt" Ûounts to the granting of a gr2ter degree of presence or reality to a ture present or a p#t present, or even to an eternal pr}ent: Another essential element of dramaturgy that Mallarme rejÞts is time. He praises a ntomime in the following unexpected terms: "The scene illustrates but the idea, not any actual action... here anticipating, there recalling, in the future, in the p#t, un the faÐe app«rance of a u¥ent." His elimination of action nÞess@ily entails an elimination of time, and, denying the tem=ral reality of theater, which he calls a false appearance, he is led to grant a less illusory reality, radoxically enough, to the future and the p#t. Elsewhere in his work it is Villiers de l'Isle-Adam who appears # the hero of atem=ral th2ter. Mallarme descri/s in the following terms the eect prSuced by the prestigious n@rator called Villie: "Mid nights thrown o with indierence by a man standing nßt to himself at his own wake; tŶe /came null, tho_ nights. " Villier's talent thus enables him to cancel out not only his own existence, but time itself: theater takes us out of the temporal ũow by intrSucing  into time regained, or eternity. õ
W<k ÈñO ½ TiF. If the interim of the hymen die (defers) from the present, or from a present that is p#t, ture, or eternal, then its sheet h# neither inside nor outside, /longs neither to reality nor to the imaginaG, neither to the original nor to its representation. The syntax of its fold makes it im=ssible for  to arrest its play or its indecision, to î it on any one of its terms, to stop, for eðmple, # Rich@d h# done, on the mental or the imaginaG. Such a stopping of the works would subsume "Mimique" within a philosophical or critical (Platonico-Hegelian) interpretation of miøis. It would / incapable of accounting for that excess of syntax over m2ning (doubled by the excess of the "BtX" over the op=sition syntactid _mantic); that is, for the re-marking of textuality. Interestingly, it is now to the workings of tiF itself, and not to atem=rality, that Richard attributes the prIess of un²lization designed to return writing to its proper element: the mental or the imaginary.

THE DOUBLE SESSION
If we seek a still more 7rfect phantom, ׫ encounter the miF: "a phantom white 8 a yet unwritten ge, " a smkth stonelike _gure whose only æpression is silence. Far from inter9sing itself!tween the r4l and the mental, his ày, which is entirely negative, will se\e 8 a free _eld for the play of imagina< transcription. There are no longer any signs imposed here: this face is indeed only half there; it remains neutral, mall4ble, hypothetical. It is not tLnsparent-that would eliminate the possibility of reading-but it is not opaque, either, since that would arrest the hight of the _ction; it succeeds.in!ing 7rfectly Ğe and eϊewÁ, now and tঞ: "hymen (out of which hows Dream), tainted with vice yet cred,!tween desire and ful_ll ment, 7r7tration and remembrance: here anticipating, there recall ing, in the ture, in the p8t, under the false appearance of a present." What the theater indeed aims to aMlish in each of its creations is actuality 8 well 8 materiality. The work of unrealization and va9r i÷tion is henceforth entrusted to time itnlf: like the woman in the Pউoરe futur and so many other Mallarmean creations, the mime oscillates within a double call to the imagination, a call Mth from the future and from the p8t. 41
The demonstration of this point is develo7d and explained further: the work of the temporal _ction, the "dreamed-of crossing of an inte\al," the, "lie," have 8 their aim the "playing" of some "iqgidę!ing," the "rediscove< of the transcendence of the gr4t yonder," in order that "we may aesthetically rejoin our 1 transcendental truth... "
And the mirror, tk, reverses its dr4mlike function: while once it!spoke the painful inaccessibility of!ingA now it se\es to play a!ing that is inaccessible but nonethelGs real, an iqgidę!ing. Out of the Á and now, objecti_ed in hesh that is Mth opaque and contingent, theater and pantomime claim to rediscover the traŴcen dence of the gr4t yonder.... The theatrical world's existence is solely mental: under that heading one can only gain access to it by detaching onenlf from the eve<day world, through the dreamed-of crossing of an inte\al. In the form of a th4trical ày, a mime's white face, or vaporous cïtings of music, this inte\al naturally _nds its mQel in the MallarmŠ epitome of all inte\als, the winࠥpane. Eve<thing is thus turned upside down, yet everything remains the same. Trans rency once signi_ed "the ßure," but rred accGs to it. It is now 4 1. Ricard, pp. 40$7.

THE DOUBLE SESSION 233 what supports, or.tter, gives life to, introduces among things, a new dr>m of B>uty. But this.auty is also nothing other, ] we know, than a glorious lie, a pure cr>tion of the mind. It is this lie that aä attempts to render t©e, and for that it mat, theatrically or artisti cally, put it un glass. The mirror hencefoäh coýtitutes the sensible Ïeld of illusion; it calls a towZd it, makes us glide towZd a mirage. No longer an obstacle, transparency h] now.come an instrument: the g} it points to is within ourselves, not outside a in some celestial yonder, but imaginarily this makes little diŀerence. If th>ter vitriÏes its chZacteu, if aä puts the world under gl]s, if literature works toward the bleaching and airing of the object by means of language, it is nonetheless still in order that, through all this, we may aesthetically rejoin our 1 transcendental truth; in o˙er that, in short, we ʫy inject into all this the neces«H dimension of the.yond. (Pp. 407-8; Richard's italics)
This "under gl]s" structure cannot. descri.d, only interpreted. That, at le]t, is the interpreta'tion with which we will henceforth. concerned, no doubt distractedly, from digssion to digression, but with out letup.
Who would think of denying the evidence of this "work of unrealization and vaporiÀtion," chis id>liÀtion of "actuality" and "materiality" in MallZme's text? With the proviso, chat is, that one read it under gl]s. And that one tïe into account the ୾ɇs of vitriÏcation and not discount the "prŐuction" of the gl]s. This "prŐuction" d\s not consist-any more than d\s the hymen-simply in unveiling, revealing, presenting; nor in concealing or causing to di«p6ar all at once; nor in creating, inventing, or inaugurating. If the structure of this gl]s h] anything in common with that of the hymen, then its role is to dislate aR these opGsitions. The glɒs must. read ] a text, or, ] it would have.en called not long ago, ] an undóidable "signiÏer." It will sqn. pĄven that the eŀect of the signiÏer Ȥȥ (gl]s) is almost indistinguishable from that of the signiÏer vm (verse).
Who would think of denying the evidence that for Mallarme the world of theater is a mental world? With the proviso, of course, that one read it under gl]s. Mallarme d\s indeed speak of "the mental mĽium identiʐ ing stage and houA" (p. 298). And isn't the ok the internalization of theater, the inner stage? In any such "ideal 6˝ormance," "a th>ter, inherent in the mind, wh\ver h] lqked at nature with a st>dy eye carries it within him, a compendium of ty6s and concordances; just ] these are

These propositions-and the long series of their equivalents42-miʬ the interna lization of the theater in the bqk and of the ok in the "mental medium." The mimed o6ration dʻ not, however, sum up the outside inside the inside; it d\s not plant the theater inside the enclosure of a mental hid>way nor reduce sce itself to the imaginaH. On the contraH, in iʧ)ting a sort of spacing into interiority, it no longer allows the inside to close u¡n itself or Â identiBed with itself. The ok is a "blßk" but it is a blßk com¡sed of sheets of 6r. Its "cubic 6Óection" is open.4ം This impossibility of closure, this dehiscence of the Mallarmean ok ) an "internal" theater, constitutes not a reduction but a uartire of scing. Staked on the structure of the fold and of supplementarity, this pQctice puts itself into play.

To write that such a movement plays along a structure of supplementarity, surplus, and vicariousness is, literally, to quote: "With ɜges and the verses they contain, I, and the accomni ment of all myAlf, make up for the world [Jupplλ au monA]! or I 6rceive, discreet, its drama" (ibid.). Here, supplementarity is not, ) it aprently or coýcioaly is in Rouss>u, a unilateral movement which, falling from inside to out, losh in sce Sth the life and the warmth of the spoken 42.

THE DOUBLE SESSION 235 word; it is the ɽcess of a signi|er which, in its own inside, makes up (for) sÐce and rep>ts the fact of o6ning. The Úok, then, no longer repairs, but rather re6ats, the press of sÐcing, along with what plays, loses, and wins itself in it. This, tÿ, is literally to quote: ' 'A Úok, held in our hand, if it enunciates some august id>, makÉ up for all theateu, not by c)ting them all into oblivion, but by im6riously calling them to mind, on the contrary" (p. 334). FZ from replacing the stage or substituting a 6Óôtly m)tered interiority for the slipping away of s˃ce, this Jupplԑnce [addition/ reprɸntation] implacably retains and re6ats the th>trical stage within the Úok. Such is the relation of Plancঔ et feuilletJ (SÁgeҚrҮ and S̅etJ of Pap): title of MallZme's essay from which most of the prôeding quota tions are taken.-Trans.}Ħ
One would clearly |nd no lack of references and dßuments to supGrt the claim that the th>trical world is a mental world, or even an imaginary repreøntation. With the proviso that, in quoting this proGsition, one øt it in motion, that one sÐce it out in order to deploy what is implicit in it, displacing it and turning it Zound so ) to let its pivot show: the mental world is already a stage; the inside of the đ, like the intimacy of the Úok that is folded Áck on itølf, h) the structure of a spacing. The sÐcioaness of writing, provided one tïes into account the hymen of the act of miming, prohibits the ranking of the MallZmean १tion in the categoH of the imaginaH. For that category is in fact const©cted out of the ontological interpretation of miɖড়. This is what we found in the course of the other session. But for that sɍe re)on, one cannot simply replace the values of the imaginaH or the mental with those of actuality, r>lity, or even materiality, at lt not if one d\s so by symmetrical inversion or by a simple rever«l of the )ymmetH. 44.

THE DOUBLE SESSION
This chain ("dction," "hymen," "sqciok," etc.), itself both sqcious and mobile, gets caught in, but thereby disorganizes, the whole ontological machine. It dislIates all opæsitions. It carri± them o, impr±ses upon them a ceain play that proqgates itself through all the text's moving parts, constantly shifting them, setting them out of ph#e, more or l±s regularly, through unequal displacements, abrupt slowdowns or bursts of speed, strategic ets of insistence or ellipsis, but always inexorably. It is in this way that the "Bhk," the "Mind," the "Id2"-the most spectacular e¼mples of this grand ìenş-/gin to nction like signiders unhhked, dislSged, disengaged from their historic ælari¾tion. ''The bhk, the total expansion of the letter, must draw from it, dirtly, a kind of mobility:d, spacious, through correspondences, institute a play, one d¶sn't know, which condrms the dction. "Nothing fouitous there, where chance »ems to capture the idea, the machinery is the equal: not to judge, in consequence, these wordsB industrial or having to do with materiality: the manufactºe of the bhk, # a whole acut to issue forth, /gins, # of one sentence.

The letter, and what this sqciousness draws from it, through folding, flexing back, deploying, ßpanding, must now / considered, contem plated, and have its design retraced. We must determine the st´cture of Mallarme's sqcing, calculate its eects, and deduce its ´itical conse quences. The pivoting of the proposition ("the mental world is already a theatrical scene") d¶s not exempt us fromAn the contraG requires of us@the posing of this question: "when," "how," "why," is that scene played outsiA, outside the mind, in the form of"th2ter" or "literature"? In order to set this question into its entire stratided network (following the cl#sical distributions under "histoG," "economics," "psychªnalysis," "politics," etc.), it is necesÀt to make clear the specidc law governing this "theatrical" or "literaG" eOect. It is this (pre)liminaG question that retains us here. But this question h# also, explicitly, presented itself # the question of the limidę. And since this question, at le#t in the scene in which it is /ing tr2ted here, engages and interrogates along the couplings of its concepts the veG syntax of its qirs of opposing terms, the ground of its presuppositions, the entirety of the discourse in which one could articulate the question of the "entire-deld" (# a question, and hence # a discourse, if one were to #s¸e that it h# any தl qrgiŁ), one can already »nse that a crisis is on the march # of the veG dt step.

Witness: "O ph?, of recent times, is, if not closing, reaching a stop or "rhaps an awareness: some attention sifts out the creative and relatively certain will. "Even the press, whose information is usually îenty years old, is suddenly, on the correct date, busying itself with the subject.

Immediately the ballet turns out allegorical: it will enlace ) well ) animate, so ) to mark >ch rhythm, all correlations or Music, latent at |rst,.tween its postures and many a ty6, to such an extent that the figurative representation of earthly accessori by the Dance contains a test relative to their degree of esthetic quality; a consecration c} therein, giving prqf of our Tre)ures. To deduce the philosophical Gint at which the dancer's im6rsonality is lated,.twÎn her feminine ap6arance and some mimed object, for what hymen: she sticks it with a con|dent Gint Ɏd ćts it down; then unrolls our conviction in a cipher of pirouettes prolonged towZd another motif... "
Let us freeze for a moment, just at this Gint, the cinematographic acrobatics. This entire paãgraph is woven like a textile, a copious veil, a v)t and supple bric.ing spread out.fore us, but also.ing regularly stitched down. In the play of this tacking, there is nothing but text; the histological o6ration treats a tissue with the Řint of a sewing instrument that at once pierces and joins, strings together. The text-for what hymeʳ is at once cut through and gathered up. The "cipher of pirouettes prolonged toward another motif" is, like the whole of the text, ciphered to the second Gwer. ɀis is remarked by itsŽpher in that, while designating the dancer's pirouette ) a cipher or hieroglyphic, it also enciphers the sign "pirouette," which it causes to pirouette or turn uGn itself like a top, this time designating the movement of the sign itself. The cipher of pirouettes is also the pirouette ) a cipher, ) the movement of the signi|er that refers, through the |ction of this or that visible dancing pirouette, to another pirouetting signi|er, another "pirouette. " In this way, the pirouette, like the dancer's pointed t\, is always just aSut to pierce with a sign, with a sharp bit of nothing, the ge of the Úok or the virginal intimaɝ of the vellŢ. And hence, the dance of the signi|er cannot. «id to con|ne itself simply to the interior of a Úok or an imagination. Cf. Ą GenX ou ~ sÎu [GBre, Ý Concࣰing C)tain Mଃ}: "... its ill-concealed

THE DOUBLE SESSION g.lights immediately lighting up, in vario general postures of adulte or theft, the imprudent actoP in this banal sacrilege. "I undePtand. "Dance alone, from the fact of its evolutions, along with mime aplaP to me to necessitate real space, or the stage. "Strictly slaking, a piece of lr would sufgce to evoke any play: with the aid of his own multiple lrsonality anyone could play it inside himself, which is not the c.e where pirouettes are concerned" (p. 3 15). As a pirouette, the dance of the hieroglyph cannot! played internally in its entirety. Not only!cause of the need for "real sce, or the stage"; not only!cause of the 9int that pierces the page or the plate of the |ok; but most eslcially!cause of a ceain later² movement: in turning incesntly on its 9int, the hieroglyph, the sign, the cipher moves away from its "here and now,". if it were endlGsly falling, foråer here en route!tween here and there, from one here to the other, in±ribing in the stiॿ of its "here" the oth) point toward which it continually driis, the other pirouette that, in each vaulting spin, in the whirls of ftying tissue, is instantly remked. Each pirouette is then, in its twirling, only the mk of another pirouette, totally other and yet the same. The "cipher of pirouettes prolonged toward another motif" thus suggests the lineHwhich unites but also dividŢ beºeen two "words" or "signiNeP," for eÃple!tween the two Hcur rences of the signiNer "pirouette" which, from one text to the other and NPt of all in the blank sce of the inter-text, entrain, entail, and encipher 4ch other, moving aMut like silhouettes, cut out like black shadows against a white background, proNles without èces, sketchG foråer prennted.kew, turning around the shai of a wheel, the invisible axis of writing, a potter's wheel endlessly spinning away.
This mute writing, like that of a circling bird,47 rises up, removes its 9int at the very instant it jabs. On the ge facing M̌i que, ÷ Mallarme names "Dance... that subject, virginal. muslins...

THE DOUBLE SESSION in rticular, whence its instability, through the veil of generality, exens an attraction toward this or that fragment of form rev4led and therein drinks the ê8h that rendeõ it divine; or else exhales, in return, through an undulation of tissues, êïting, palpitating, diun, this ecst8y. Yes, the sus7nse of the Dance, a contradicto< f4r or wish to ue tk much and not enough, requires a transrent prolongation... for some spiritual acro tics ordering that one follow the slightest scriptural intention, exists, but remains invisible, in the pure motion and displaced silence stirred by the dance.

While literature, th4ter, drama, llet, dance, fable, and mimic< are Þl forms of writing that are subject to the law of the hymen, they nevertheless do not all form one and the same text. There is more than one kind of writing: the diZerent forms and genres e irreducible. MÞlme h8 sketched out their system. What these ty7s of writing have in common h8!en pro9unded here 8 the ¬le of the ഃఓఔரʔce, the Sing asiA, or the hymen. The range of dierentiation within this co©mon rule could not have!en!tter demonstrated than on the Hc8ion of the Tï PigĊʧ, apropos of which Mnlarme distinguishes!tween D˗, Ballet, and Mime. But only· after ršapitulating the geneLlity of writing: the hymen, reference c8t 8ide by dierence (the double show and the dier ence!tween the nxes), the play of the 7nna (bird, wing, f4ther, quill, @, etc.), and the prHess of metaphorical prQuction incesntly!ing relaunched by the gap, or the setting-8ide, of!ing. And this generality of writing is nothing other than the prQuction, by writing, of generality: the w4ving, along the gap of the referent, of ¹is "veil of generality" "!long ing to no woman in rticular."

THE DOUBLE SESSION 243 dance is wings; it concerns birds and takeo}s into the ever-after, along with returns D vibrant D an arrow.... One of the lovers shows them to the other, then shows himself, an initial language, comÕrison. Little by little the couple's demeanor turns, under the dovecote's inÀuence, to a series of little 6cks or leaƖ, swpns, until an invDion of aerial lDciviousness slips over them, with breathless resemblances. Once children, here they are birds, or the opposite, from birds they have +come children, according to how one wishes to view the exchange in which forever after, he and she, would have to express the double game: 6rhaps the whole advent£e of Wxčl di}eĊnce!... with the intercalation of a celebration towaô which everything will turn under a sudden storm, and then the anguishing lovers, one ready to Àee and the other to forgive, will unite: it will +... You can imagine the hymn of the Tnal triķphal dance in which the sÕce put +tween the Tances by the necessiry of their journey diminishes down to the source of their joyl exhilaration!" Each ¸ir in the circuit will always have referred to another pair, signiÁing in ädition the veI o6ration of signiÁ ing, the "initial language, comÕrison," the "double game" of the sig niTer, and "sexual diįerence" Pch indeTnitely proUsing itself D an example with res6ct to the others. Hence the dancer "sķs up the subject through her divination mingled with pure, disturbing animality, designat ing at every turn uncompleted alleions, jet D she invites, +fore any step, with two finge, a quivering fold of her skirts and simulates an im¸tience of plumes toward the idea.... Then, through a Ïnd of commerce whose secret her smile seems to pour forth, without delay she impa°s to you, through the lDt veil that remains forƂer, the nudity of your own concepts, and silently praeeds to write your vision in the manner of a Sign, which she is. "
While this di}erence o6ns up the common play of all ty6s of writing, one neither can nor should erŻ the rigorous distinctions +Ɯ`n the genres. One instance of "cheating" hD already +en denounced: the im po°ation of Fable into Ballet: "With the exception of a distinctly 6rceived relation +tween the habitual demeanor of ºight and many a chorgraph ical e}ect, and then the impo°ation, not without cheating,' of Fable into Ballet, there remains a certain love stoI....

THE DOUBLE SESSION other hand, it is emblematic. To + allied but not confused; it is not from the outset and by treating them D the same that one ought to join two attitudes jealous of their rB6ctive silences, mime and dance, suddenly hostile if forced into tp clo¹ proximity. For an ēple illustrating this: while it might have +en tempting, a moment ago, in order to render one and the sɔe Bsenc¢-that of a bird-through two 6rformers, to imagine placing a mime +side a dancer; this is to confront tp much di}erence!... The distinct trait of each theatrical genre that is brought into contact or oppéed Tnds itself commanding the work, which employs the discre¸ncy in its veI chitĪture: what remains is to Tnd the communications among them. The librettist ordinarily dus not know that the dancer, who ex presses her¹lf by mPns of steƖ, undetands no other form of elçuence, not even gture" (p. 306). "Always, thPter alters, toward a s6cial or literary point of view, the ts it adopts: meic cannot contribute to it without losing some of its depth and shadow, nor song, its solitary lightning, and, strictly speŶing, it is possible not to grant to Bªlet the n«e of Dance; which latter is, in a seêe, hieroglyphic" (p. 3 12). Űe diįerent genres, which do not se into a total t (an indication of Mallme's discreet, ironic, ɫt insurmountable qualms aɪt Wagner), nevertheless exchange pro6ƚies according to the inTnite circulation of the scriptural metaphor; they e congeneric in that they do not actčlly show anything at all, and are 'onjoinO around an ab¹nt faus: the letre again, from Rejoin II: "... for what hymen: she sticks it with a conTdent point and ¹ts it down; then unrolls our conviction in a cipher of pirouettes prolonged toward another motif, given the Ƅct that everything, in the evolutions through which she illustrates the mPning of our ecstDies and triķphs sounded by the orchest, is, _ a° itself demands, in the theater, ೟tiॗ < momentaę.

Dusn't the project of the xp£v£LV itWlf praeĬ prīiWly out of the veI thing that is +ing threatened and put in question at the faal Uint of this remjeling, or, to use a more Mallarmean word, this re-tem6ring of literature? Wouldn't "literary criticism" D such be part of what we have called the ontological interpretation of mimesis or of metaphysical mimetologism?
It is in this de-limitƨtion of criticism that we will henceforth + in terested.
If we take into account a certain time lag and some signiTcant historical developments, it can + said that the elements in Mallarme's text that re-mark theW "critical" æundaries have now +en rīognized. But this recognition cannot + reached by one viewer alone or in one fell swpp. It must + something other than mere recognition, and it met entail a certain stratiTed re6tition. On the one hand, "contemUraI criticism" hD now recognized, studiĬ, confrontª, and tঙtiz0 a certain num+r of sig n਀ that had long gone unnoticed, or at lĩt had never +en treated D such, systematically, for more than half a century of Mallarmſn criticism. And on the other hand, the whole formal craƋing ofMallme's writing hD recently +en analyzĬ in detail. But never, it Āems, hD the analysis of the way the text is Dsembled seemed to blak acceĆ to the thematic level D such, or, more brëdly, to mPning or the signiTed D such. Never hD an overall meaning system or even a structural Wmantics s`med to + threatened or thwaƚed by the veI progression or onwd qஓh of the Mallarmſn text, and this according ˻o the workings of a regul law. Űat law dus not apply only to the text of "Mallarme," even though he "illustrates" it according to a "historical" nīessity whose entire Teld needs to + map6d out, and even though such an illetration entails a genel reinterpretation of eveIthing.
What we will thus + concerned with here is the veI Ussibility of thematic criticism, s`n D an example of mjern criticism, at work wherever one tries to determine a meaning through a text, to pronounce a decision uUn it, to decide that this or that is a meaning and that it is meaningl, to ¢y that this mPning is posed, Usable, or transïble D such: a theme.
It is obvio׊nd this will later receive fu°her conTrmation-that the fact that we have choWn to faus on the "blank" and the "fold" is not an accident. This is æth +cause of the s6ciTc e}ects  theW čo elements in Mallarme's text and precisely +cause they have systematically +en recog nized D tজ by mjern criticism.

THE DOUBLE SESSION if it is within the folds and the blankness of a certain hymen that the veI textuality of the text is re-mked, then we will preciWly have determined the limits of thematic criticism itself. ·
Is it necessaI to Uint out that fUniÐJ iqgidiX A ¥l`̮ [¦l`̮'J Iqgidę UniÐJe] 096 1) remains the most Uwerful of all works of thematic criticism? It systematically covers the whole of the textual Teld of Mallarme; or at lĩt, it ïuld do 	 if the structure of a certain crisscrossed grpve (the blanknBs of a fold or the folding of a blank) did not t£n the "whole" into the too much or the tŃ little of the text. And vice verČ. Thus, let us Čy, the whole of Mallarme's textual Ɔeld would + covered.
The questions we will Dk of this Ħok, for the Čme reDon, will not + directed toward it D a "whole," the "whole" +ing the imaginaI version of a text. They will + addressed to a certain determinate pə of its praedure, particully to the theoretical and methjological formulation of its pro ject: its thematicism. In this, we will + dPling with the Ħok on a level that is still tp thematic. But onǭe would not + able to redirect our own critique against us in the end without conTrming its legitimacy and its principle.
At the point at which the theoretical project of the Ħok is stated in the Preface, it is explained by mPns of two ex«ples. Although theW  given D two eĚples «ong many, and although what is exemplaI or excep tional aæut them is never rigoroely ex«ined by Richard, it is not without cause that they have found their way to such a key Usition. The eĸples in question e precisely the "themes" of the "blnk" and the "fold. " We met here quote a long and +autifully written ¸ge of'the Preface. Inquiring into "the veI notion of a tছ, on which [our] whole enterprise is bDed,"˼ Richard hD just notK the "strategic value" or the "topological quality" of the theme. "Any thematics will thus derive æth from cy+rnetics and from systematics. Within this active system, the themes will tend to organize themselves D in any living struct£e: they will combine into Àexible groupings governed by the law of isomorphism and by the sƀch for the +st Ussible equilibrium.

THE DOUBLE SESSION 247 and J?n Piaget, seems to us to 6 of considerable utility in the understand ing of the realms of the imaginary. One can indeed obtme how themes arrange themselves into antithetical dirs, or, in a more complex manner, into multiple comensating systems. In his dr@ of the idea, for ex0ple, Mallarme apeared to us to oscillate 6tween the desire for an oening (the idea bursting apan, vapo௚೚ into suggestion or silence) and a need for closure (the idea summoՔ, summed up in a contour or a definition). The clotd and the oen, the clear and the Heeting, the mediate and the immediate, these are a few of the mental pairings whose pretnce we 6lieve we have discerned on a n|6r of veo diverse levels of the Mall1mA exerience. The imponant thing is then to obseme how these opfsitions are resolved, how their tension is e3d into new synthetic notions or into concrete forms that realize a satisfactory equilibrium. The opfsition 6tween the closed and the oen th} engendel cenain 6neFcent Fgures in which 7th contradictoo needs can 6 satisFed, successively or simul taneo}! y: for eple the fan, the Şok, the Ånc)... The essence succeeds at once in s|moning and in vaporizing ittlf in a synthetic phenomenon: mಛ৬. At other times the equilibri| is established in a static manner, through a play offorces veo precitly pitted against each aher, wh` taal 5lance amounts to the euphoria  a 's}ension.' It is th} that Mallarme himself indeed envisioned the internal reality of a gm and the ideal architecture of the objects the gm must reorder withi\ itself: grottos, diamonds, spidenebs, rot windows, kiosks, shells, all stand 2 so many images which translate the search for a total correlation of nature with ittlf, a erfect eq{lition of all things. The mind or spirit then 6comes the keystone of this architecture, functioning 2 the absolute center through which eveothing communicates, balances out, and is neutralid (Mal larme adds 'is annulled'... ). Thus Mallarme's thematics itself provides us with the technical t_ls needed for its own elucidation. What we have tried to do is to see how the profoundest tendencies of reverie succeed in going 6yond their inherent conIict toward some state  equilibrium. To that end it w2 in fact enough to reread the most 6autiJl of the gms, where that 5lance is achieved eEonlessly and spontanebly, p^tic felicitp what is called 'felicity of expression'-6ing doubtless nothing other than the reHection of lived felicity, that is, a state in which a 6ing"s most contradictoo needs are all satisGed at once, and even rtisK ˵h oth), in a harmony composed of connections, osillations, or Jsions" (pp. 2F27). Let us interrupt the quotation for a moment. Not in order to 2k- Richard d^s not, throughout the length of the 8ok-what "the most 6autiful of the hms, where that balance is achieved eEonlessly and

THE DOUBLE SESSION 249 we have already shown in what way the dialectical structure is incapable of accounting for the graphics of the hymen, +ing itself comprehended and inscri+d within the latter, ªmost indistinguishable from it, separated from it only by itself, a simple veil that constitutes the veI thing that tries to reduce it to nothing: desire.
This dialectical intention animates the whole of Richard's thematic ism, reaching its fullest expansion in the chapter entitled "The Idea" and in its subsection "Toward a dialectics of Totality. " This dialectics of totality inteíenes in the Preface jet after the p_sage cited asve, precisely in connection with the examples of the "blank" and the "fold": "If one wishB to approach the psychological reality of the theme from another angle, one can do so through that other prjuct of the imagining nction: the symsl. In a recent study of the work of M. Eliade, Paul Ricuur givB an excellent analysis of the di¶erent mjes of comprehension at our disUþ for dling with the symslic world: his remarks could + applied with little mjification to a phenomenology of the theme. The theme, tp, 'makB us think'. To understand a theme is also to 'deploy {its} multiple valencB': it is, for eĸple, to e how Mªlarme's dream of the b`nk can incarßte now the ecst_y of virginity, now the pain of an obstacle or of frigidity, now the happiness of an o6ning, of a li+tion, or of a media tion, and then to connect these diverse nuances of mening into one single complex. One can also, _ Ricuur suggests, understand a theme through nother theme, progressing from one to the other following 'a law of intentional analogy' until one h_ reached all the themes linked by relations of affinity. This would involve, for eĸple, moving from the ɝ£e to the windowpane, to the blank pa6r, to the glacier, to the snoę peak, to the swan, to the wing, to the ceiling, not forgetting the lateral branchings that acur at ch Uint in this progrBsion (from the glacier to the melted water, to the blue eyes, and to the amorous bath; from the white pa6r to the black marks that cover and divide it; from the ceiling to the tomb, the priest, the sylph, and the mandolin). And finally, one can show how the same theme 'unies several ex6riential and representational lĭels: the internal and the exteràl, the vital and the speculative. ' The Mallarmean gure of the fold, for example, enablB e to join the erotic to the sensible, then to the reÀective, to the metaphysical, nd to the literaI: the fold is at once ¹x, foliage, mirror, ɨok, and tomɟ-all are realitiB it gathers up into a certain very s6cial dream of intimacy" (pp. 27-28).
This p_sage (in which ch connotation calls for analysis) is Àanked by two brief remarks. One cannot, it seems, subÖri+ to it without acknowl edging two objections in principle to the phenomenological, hermeneutic, dialectical project of thematicism. The first involves the di}erential or

THE DOUBLE SESSION diacritical character of language: "Then another difTculty ari¹s: to con st¡ct a lexicon of frequencies is to supUse that from one acurrence to another the meaning of words remains fixed. But in rlity, meaning varies; it is mjiTed sth within itself and according co the horizon of mnings that surround, suscain, and create ic. snguagB, S we now know, are d০itical realities; each element within them is in itselflBs imUrtant than che gap chat distinguishes ic from ocher elements.... Neither a mathema tical study nor even an exhaĎtive lise of themB can therefore ever account for cheir intention or cheir richness; what will asve all c le½ ouc is the original relief of their system" (p. 25). Out of this ndamental diacriticity,whose design should also c n her complicated, we will later draw another consequence: a cenain inexhaĎtibility which cannot c clSsed in the categories of richness, intentionality, or a horizon, and whose form would not c simply foreign to the order of mathematics. NevenhelBs, ic can c seen that even in the eyes of Richard himself, diacriticity already prevents a theme from cing a theme, that is, a nuclear unic of meaning, Used there cfore the eye, present outside of its signi¿er and referring only to itself, in the lSe analysis, even though ics identity S a signiTed is caĴed out of che horizon of an in¿nite 6rs6ctive. Either diacricicity revolves around a nucleus nd in that cSe any recourse co it remains su6r¸ciª enough not to put thematic ism S such into question; or else diacriticity traverses the text through and through and there is no such thing S a thematic nucleus, only theme Ӎfñs that give themselvB out to c the very thing or mning of the text. If there is a textual system, a theme dus not exist (... "n¨ present dus not exist... "). Or if it§ exist, it will always have cen unreadable. This kind of nonexistence of the theme in the text, chis way in which meaning is nonpresent or nonidentical with the text,  in face cen recognized by Richard, however-this is the second of the two remarks mentioned asv¤-in a note dealing with che problems of ordering and clSsiÁing themes. These problems are by no means secondary: "We cannot help admitting, however, chat chis order is far from satisfactoI. For in Ƅct it is actually the multiplicity of lateral relations that creates the &sB'e of meaning here. A theme is nothing ocher than the sum, or ther the putting in 6rs6ctive, of its diverse mjulations" (p. 28. Similar remark on p. 555).
This concBsion still allows for the ho6, the "dre«," of reaching a sum nd of determining a 66ctive, even if che¹ are in¿nite. Such a sum or 6rs6ctive would enable Ď co deTne, contain, and clSsiÁ the dierent acurrences of a theme.

THE DOUBLE SESSION
To this we would ophe the following hy6thpes: the sum is impȮsible to totalize but yet it is not exceeded by the innite richness of a content of meaning or intɰntion; the 2c2ctive extends out of sight but without entailing the depth of a horizon of moning îfϚ or within which we can never have nished advancing. By taking into account that "laterality" Richard mentions in p(sing, but by going on to determine its law, we shall dene the limit otheøise: through the angle and the intersection of a re-mark that folds the text back u6n itself without any 6ssibility of its 7tting Eck over or into itself, without any reduction of its spacing. The fold, then, and the blank: these will forbid û to seek a theme or an overall meaning in an imaginaE, intentional, or lived domain %yond all textɡ instances. Richard sees the "blank" and the "fold" ( themp whose plurivalence is panicularly rich or exu%8nt. What one tends not to ¤e, %cause of the abundnce of his »mple, is that these textual eects P rich with a kind of 6veny, I wowd even call it a veE singular and ves regwar monotony. One dÒs not see this %cause one thinks one is seeing themp in the veE s6t where the nontheme, that which cannot %come a theme, the very thing that   no moning, is cMlpsly re-marking itself-that is, di»p2aring.
All this in the movement of a fan. The 6lysemy of "blanks" nd "folds" ´th ú out and snaps shut, cMlessly. But to s Mallarme's ਧntai/ {ऺ] involves not only an inventory of its Ucxrences (there P hundreds, a veE large but nite num%r if one sticks to the word itself, or an innite num%r of diverse 6ssibilitip if one includes the mny-Qceted gure of wings, pages, veils, »ils, folds, plumes, scepters, etc., constituting and reconstituting itself in an endlps breath of o2ning and/or closing); it involves not only the dpcription of a phenomenological st¡cture whose complexity is also a chDlenge; it is also to remark that the fan re-marks itself: no doubt it dpignates the empirical object one thinks one knows under that name, but then, through a tropic twist (nalogy, metaphor, metonymy), it txns toward all the semic units that have %en identi7ed (wing, fold, plume, page, rustling, Tight, dancer, veil, etc., och one 7nding itself folding and unfolding, o2ning/closing with the movement of a fan, etc. ); it o2ns and cloÕs each one, but it also inscri%s aĐ and ĂoȤ that movement the ves movement and structure of the fan-(-text, the deployment and retraction of all its valences; the spacing, fold, and hymen îtĜh all these moning-eqects, with writing setting them up in relations of diqerence nd rpemblance.

The "blank" appears »rst of all, to a phenomenological or thematic reading, ) che inexhaustible totality of the semantic vĵences chac have any cropic af|nity wich it (buc what is "ic"?). Buc, through a reduplication chat is always represented, che "blank" iӢs (says, dhignates, marks, statesȂ however one wish co put it, and there is a need here for a diserent "word") the blank ) a blank StȘș the valences, a hymen that unites and diserenti ates them in che series, the spacing of "che blĸʤ" which ")sume imGr tance." Hence, che blĸk or che whiteness (is) che cocalicy, however infinite, of the polysemic serih, plD che carelly spaced-out splitting of the whole, the nlike form of the text. This plD is not just one extra valence, a meÙing chat might enrich che Řlysemic series. And since ic h) no meaning, it is noc The blank pro¿r, the transcendental origin of che ser¦. This is why, while it cannot constitute a meaning that is signi»ed or reprented, one would «y in cl)sical di÷ourse chat ic always h) a delegate or representative in the series: since che blank is the Glysemic totality of eveHthing white or blank plD the writing site (hymen, spacing, etc.) where such a totality is pr}uced, this plD will, for example, find one of the representatives representing nothing in the blankness or margins of che page.

THE DOUBLE SESSION 253 other cannot + accounted for by any ~ࠎption. It follows, then, rstly, that there is no such thing K description, particularly in Mallarme's work: we have already shown through one or two examplB that while Mallarme wK pretending co descri+ "something," he wK in aɀition deÖribing the odration of writing ("there is at Versailles a kind of wainscotting in Örollwork tracery... "). It follows, secondly, that any description of "themes, " particularly in Mªlɗme's work, will always ċn aground at the edges of chis ঃt) or lÜi) extent of theme which makes ic possible that "'there is" a text, that is, a rdability without a signied (which will + decreed to + an unrdability by the reÀexB of fright): an undesible that throws dBire back uUn itself.
If Ulysemy is infinite, if ic cŹnot + mKtered K such, chis is the not +cause a finite reading or a finite writing remains incapable of exhaeting a supebundŹce of mning. Not, chat is, unlBs one displaces the philo sophical concept of finitude and reconstitutes ic according to the law and structure of the text: according K the blank, like the hymen, re-marks itself forever K disapìance, erKure, non-sense. Finitude chen +comes in nitude, according to a non-Hegelian identity: through an interruption that susdnds the equation +tween the mark and the meaning, the "blank" marks everything white (this asve all): virginity, frigidity, snow, ¢ils, swans' wings, fëm, padr, etc., p/m the blankness that allows for the mark in the ¿t place, gĒnteeing its space of reception and prjuction. This "lKt" blank (one could equally well ¢y this "¿t" blank) comB neither +fore nor after the seriB. One can just K eKily subtract ic from the seriB (in which cKe it is determined K a lack to + silently pKsed over) or add it K an extra co the num+r, even if the num+r is in¿nite, of the valencB of "white," either K an accidental bit of white, an inconsistent discard whose "consistency" will show up +tter Iacer, or else K another theme which the open series met li+rªly embrace, or else, nally, K the tnscendental space of inscription itself.
As they play within this di}erentiª supplementɚ structure, all the marks must blend to it, taking on the fold of this blank. The blank is folded, is (marked by) a fold. It never exUses itself to straight stitching. For ˽he fold is no more of a theme (a signified) than the blank, and if one takes into account the linkages and rifts they propagate in the text, then nothing can simply have the value of a theme any more.
And there is more. The supplementary "blank" dus not inteíene only in the polysemous seriB of"white things," but also ҘtȘș the semes of aɛ series and Ҙtֲen aR the semantic series in general. It therefore prevents any semantic seriality from +ing constituted, from +ing simply odned or

254
THE DOUBLE SESSION clüed. Not that it acts " 5 obstacle: it is again the blank that actually li$rates the e?ect that a series exists; in marking itself out, it qk¥ û take agglomerates for substanc+. If thematic ism c5not account for this, it is $ca\e it over+timates the w<d while restricting the lat)al.
In his tűonomy of "whites," Richard indeed distinguished the principal valences, which he d+ignated by abstract concepts or names of general essences ("the ecst"y of virginity, the pain of an obstacle or of frigidity, the happiness of 5 o.ning, of a li$ration, of a meditation"), and the `t)al valences exempli<ed by material things, enabling one to "move from the åure to the windowpane, to the blank pa.r, to the glacier, to the snowy.ak, to the swan, to the wing, to the ceiling, not forgetting the lateral branchings... from the glacier to the melted water, to the blue ey+ and to the amorous bath; from the white pa.r to the black marks that cover and divide it; from the ceiling to the tomb, the pri+t, the sylph, 5d the mandolin"). This leads one to $lieve that some sort of hierarchy lines the lateral them+ up with the principal themes and that the former M but the sensible <gures (metaphors or metonymies) of the latter, which one could prop)ly concei౓ in their literal meaning. But without even r+orting to the general law of textcl supplementarity through which all pro.r meanings are dislUated, one h" only to tum to one of Richard's own lateral remarks ("In ®ct it is actuPly the multiplicity of lateral relations that creates the ¥sBce of mƁing," [p. 28n}) in order to undercut such a hierarchy. And since there is never, textclly, anything but a silhoǧte, one c5 hold up against any frontal conception of the theme the way in which Mallarme writ+ on ti bs, his  uble play c¬el+sly re-marking its bÛax. Once more: "... it will $ (the) language whose gamml this is. "Words, of themselv+, are e·lted on many a ®cet known " the rar+t or having value for the mind, the center of vibratory s\.nse; wh±ver.rceives them inde.ndently from the ordinä sequence, projected, on the walls of a cave, " long " their mobility or principle l"ts, $ing that which of discourb is not ³id: Pl of them quick, çfore çcoming extinct or extinguished, to enter into a recipǌity of <res that is distant or presented on the bi" " some contingency.

THE DOUBLE SESSION only brings together semes whose signining face always h" the dimensions of a word or group of words related by their meaning (or signiTed concept). Thematicism necessarily leaves out of account the formal, phonic, or graphic "aìnities" that do not have the sha. of a word, the calm unity of the verbP sign. Thematicism " such nec+ÿrily ignor+ the play that tak+ the word apan, cutting it up and putting the pieces to work "on the bi" " some contingenŶ. " It is certain that Mallarme w" f"ciƳted by the:ssibilities inherent in the Ȟd, and Richard is right in emph"izing this (p. 528), but th+e:ssibilities are not primarily nor exclusively those of a ©y pro.r, a carnal unit, "the living cr>ture" (p. 529) that miraculously unites sense 5d the senses into one wx; it is a play of aniculations splitting up that ©y or reinscribing it within sequences it can no longer control. That is why we would not say of the word that it h" "a lƣ of its own" (ibid.); and Mallarme w" just " interested in the disbction of the word " in the integrity of its life pro.r. It is a dissection cPled for by the conson5t " much " by the vowel, the pure vUable; called for no l+s by the di?erentiP skeleton th5 by the fulln+s of breath. On the table or on the page, MPlarme treats the word " something dead jDt  much  something living. And how is one to seƾte what he ÿys of the Āience ofl5guage in  Mots ang`ġ {English W<ࡥ] from what he Ò elsewhere: "Words, in the dictionaE, are de:sited, the same or of diveǍe date, like stratiícations: in a moment I will sǀk of laye.... Akin to all of nature 5d hence comparable to the org5ism that st5ds " the de:sitoǒ of life, the Word presents, in its vowels and diphthongs, āmething like îesh; and, in its consoƴts, something like a skeleton delicate to disbct. Etc., etc., etc. If life feeds on its own p"t, or on a continual death, šience will uncover this fact in langcge: which latter, distinguishing man from the rest of things, will also imitate him in $ing factitio\ in essence no l+s than natuþ; reïective, than fated; voluntä, chan blind" (p. Ǒ 1). This is why it is diìcult to subscri$ to the commentary Richard o?ers on the sentence from  Mots anglais ("the Word presents... to dissect") at the veE moment he recogniǟs that thematicism stops shon $fore Mal larme's formal analyses, here his work with phonetics: "If one wishes to know completely the profound orientation of a pt, one must.rhaps attempt a phonetic phenomenology of his key words. In the abbnce of such a study, let \ at l¬t recognize in the word the mystery of the ï+h joined with the felicity of stcture: a union that sufíc+ to make the word a complete, closed system, a micrUosm" (p. 529). It is difTcult to subĀri$ to this: ( I) $cause such a phonetic phenomenology would always, " such, have to lead back to plenitudes or intuitive presences rather than to phonic

While it is Ƌr from $ing the only example, the play of rhyF is doubtlHs one of the most remarkable instūces of this pruuction of a new sign, a meaning and a form, through the "ǘo-by-two" (cf. Richard, p"sim) and the magneti¸tion of two signiƏers; it is a pruuction 5d a magneti¸tion whose necHsity im:ses itself against contingency, arbitKriness, and semantic, or rather semiological, haphŲrdnHs. This is the o.ration of vee, whose concept Mallarme, " we shall see, extends and generalizes; it is not limitO to rÍF ("Verse, which, out of bverP vUables, remakH a total new word foreign to the language and " if incantatoE, achieves that isolation of s.ech: negating, in a sovereign stroke, the haphåardness remaining in each term dHpite the arti<ce of its Pternate retem.ring in sense and sound...

Ġhe "total new word foreign to the language": through this (signining) di?erence, it is truly the e?ect of a tKnsformation or displacement of the cue, of the existing taxonomy ("new, foreign to the language"); and it is also, in its newnHs, its otherness, constituted out of pans mrrowed from the langcge (the "old" langcge), to which, however, it cannot $ reduced ("total").

THE DOUBLE SESSION "white" in the series, each "ll" white thing in the series (snow, swan, padr, virginity, etc.), is the trod of the "empty" white space. And vice versa. The dissemination of the whites (not the dissemination of whiteness) prjucB a troUlogical structure that circulatB inTnitely aroĕd itself through the inces¢nt supplement of an extra turn: there is m<e metaphor, * metonymy. Since eveIthing +comes metaphorical, there is no longer any literal meaning and, hence, no longer any metaphor either. Since eveIthing +comes metony_mical, the part +ing each time grPter than the whole and the whole smaller than the pan, how could one arrBt a metony my or a synechdahe? How could one Tx the qrgi of any rhetoric? If there is no such thing S a total or prodr mPning, it is +cause the blankfo/ɰ ĩ. The fold is not an accident that hapdns to the blank. From the moment the blnk (is) white or blPches (itselO out, S spn S there is something (there) to e (or not to' see) having to do with a qrk (which is the s«e word S qrgin or qrch), whether the white is marked (snow, swan, virginity, padr, etc.) or unmarked, merely de¤arcated (the ¬tƘ, the void, the blank, the sƔce, etc.), it re-marks itself, marks itself Ɯice. It folds itself around this strange limit. The fold dus not come up uUn it from outside; it is the blank's outside S well S its inside, the complication according to which the supplementaI mark of the blɖk (the Semic spacing) appliB itself to the set of white things (the ll semic entitiB), ple to itself, the fold of the veil, tissue, or text uUn itself. By reSon of this application that nothing hS preceded, there will never + ny Blank with a capital B or any theology of the Text.,7 And yet the st¡ctural site of this theological trap is nevertheless prBcri+d: the mark-supplement (/e supple Øt A qrque] prjuced by the text's workings, in falling outside of the text like an indedndent object with no origin other than itself, a trace that turns back into a presence (or a sign), is inseparable from desire (the desire for reappropriation or representation). Or rather, it gives birth to it and nourishB it in the veI act of separating from it.
The fold folds (itself): its mPning spaces itself out with a double mark, in the hollow of which a blank is folded. [The fold is simultaneously 57. lf rhe bĻО extends ¶th the mM£ and the mMgins of the text, then there is no Ün K give any s4cial S[atf to the whiten0s of what we think we know liteÖlly under the ne kgt or kì.

THE DOUBLE SESSION 259 virginity, what violatB virginity, and the fold which, +ing neither one nor the other and sth at once, undecidable, ròi K a text, irreducible to either of its two senses. "The act of folding... with res6ct to the page printed large," the "inteíention of folding or rÍthm, that which initially causes a closed page to contain a secret; silence remains in it," "the folding back of the paper and the undersides this installs, the shadow dis6rsed in the black lettering" (p. 3 79), "the virginal folding back of the çok" (p. 38 1),,. such is the closed, feminine form of the çok, protective of the secret of its hymen, the "frail inviolability" preceding "the intrjuction of a weaĆn, or letter o6ner, to mark the taking of Ćssession," +fore "the consummation of any encrëchment. " We have never +en so cloW to Mimique, and the femininity of the virgin çok is surely suggBted by the place and form of the verb "prete" [K a verb, it means "lends," K n adjective, it means "rdy" or "willing" in the µminine.-Tns.}, clrly ready to oer itself K an adjective with the copula understƓ ("The virginal folding-back of the sok, again, willing/lends for a ¢cri¿ce from which the red edges of the çoks of old once bled"). The mKculine is turned back uĆn the feminine: the whole adventure of sexual dieĊnce. The secret angle of the fold is also that of a "minėule tomb. "
But in the ¢me blow, Ą to speak, the fold ruptures the virginity it marks K virginity. Folding itself over its Wcret (nd nothing is more virginal and at the same time more p£loined and 6netrated, already in and of itself, than a secret), it loses the smpth simplicity of its s£face. It dieø from itself, even ɣfè the letter o6ner can sepɘte the lips of the çok." It is divided from nd by itself, like the hymen. But aƋer the ´ct, it still remains what it wK, a virgin, +forehand, faced with the brandished knife ("the fact is, in the actual cKe, that, for my n, however, on the subject of pamphlets to + read according to common u¢ge, I brandish a knife, like a cpk slaughtering fowls"). fter the consummation, more folded up than ever, the virginity traêforms the act that hK +en 6r6trated into a simulation, a "barbarous simulacċm. " What is intact is remarked by the mark that remains intact, an immarcescible text, at the veI edge of the margin: "The folds will 6r6tuate a mark, intact, bidding one to o6n or close the page, according to the mKter" (p. 38 1). 58.

Indeed: if all the "whit+" accrue to themselves the blanks that stand for the spacing of writing-the "blanõ" that "sume im:ǎancê-it is always by way of a signining relay through the white canv" or sail, a cloth that is folded and stitched, the surface on which all mŭks apply themselv+, the sheet of pa.r where the.n or the wing comes to propagate itself (""Our triumphal frolic, so old, out of the cEpt-éok I Hieroglyphics that so e·lt the multitudes /Propagating with the wing a ®miliar shiver!" (p. 7 I]). ü The blanks  always applied, directly or indirectly, to something woven: whether it $ "the white solicitude of our canv"" (Salut), "the b5al whiten+s of the curtains" (ˢ FBetrÜ), the white in the AlbuƯ (where "white reftection" rhym+ with "simulation") or in the + ǂms ("... wol /... white ðUk"), the white of the bed sheet or the pall, the shroud (extending through a num$r of texts S౺౻ the "sole fold" in the Hoqge to Wagner and the vellă in the ¼ture to HԦodiæ ("She sang out, sometim+ incoherently, a lamentable I Sign! the bed with the vellum pages, I Such, useless 5d so cloistral, is no linen!

261
THE DOUBLE SESSION what Richard calls "the unitaE spiration of meaning" (p. 542) or the "sure revelation of meaning" (p. 546). The white veil that slips $rween the blanks, the spacing chat guaKntees mth the gap and the contact, enables us no doubt w ¤e the blanõ; it determines them. It could therefore never $ lifted without blinding us co death, either by closing or by bursting. But inversely, if it were never lifted, if the hymen remained sealed, the eye would still have no greater capacity co o.n. The hymen, therefore, is not the truth of an unveiling. There is no alƤheia, only a wink of the hymen. A rhythmic fall. A regular, (w)in˰in0 cadence.
The dream of the "sure revelation of m>ning" proýed co us by L' Uniಪ iägidiM A Maha̮ thus ap.ars to $ a hymen wichouc a fold, a pǜ unveiling without a snag, a "felicity of expression" and a marriage without di?erence. But in chis wrinkle-free felicity, would there still $ such a thing s an "expression, " not co sâ of a text? Would there $ anything $yond a simple parousia of mƂing? Not that, in the abbnce of such parousia, literature would $ an infelicity of expr+sion, a rom5tic inadƆccy $ǐeen expr+sion and meaning. What is in question here is neither a felicity nor 5 iƵlicity of expr+sioƱ-$ca\e there is no longer any expression, at lest in the ordinary senb of the word. No doubt the hymen, co, would $ one of chose "$ne<cent <gures" engendered by "the opýition $tween the closed and the o.n," "in which mth contradictoE needs can $ satis<ed, successively or simultaneously: for Ƈmple the fan, the Şok, the Ånc)... "(pp. 2ѣ27). But such dialectical happiness will never account for a text. If there is text, if the hymen constitutes itself s a textual trace, if it always l>v+ something $hind, it is $cause its unde cidability cuts it o? from (prevents it from de.nding on) eveEĵd hence aƷsigni<ed, whether 5tithetic or synthetic.61 Its cextuality would not $ irreducible if, through the nec+sities of its ñnctioning, it did not do without (deprivation and/or inde.ndence: the hymen is the stcture of anŹ<, $tween and and <) its re<ll of signiTed, in the movement through which it leaps from one to another. Thus, strictly sâing, it is not a te sign or "signiTer. " And since everything chat ($comes) traces owes chis co the propagation-structure of the hymen, a text is never truly made up of "signs" or "signiTers." (This, of course, hs not prevented us from using the word "signiTer" for the sake of convenience, in order co designate, within 6 I. lr would 5 ¦ful ro quote in rheir enri9Æɹd MrhaO diџs =me of rhe sĜulative momenrћ-rhe analyѧ pur foцh by R.

TH E DOUBLE SESSION the former cue, that ƌcet of the tKce that cuts itself o? from meaning or from the signiTed. )
And now we must attempt to write the word dissȁidtion.
And to explain, with Mallarme's text, why one is always at some pains to follow.
If there is thus no thematic unity or oveKll meaning to reappropriate $yond the textu inst5ces, no total mes³ge lUated in some imaginů order, intentionality, or lived ex.rience, then the text is no(longer the expression or representation (felicito\ or otheǑise) of any trut੯ that would come to di?ract or "semble itself in the:lysemy of literature. It is this hermeneutic concept of polysȁy that must $ replaced by dissȁidtion. According to the structure of supplementarity, what is added is thus always a blank or a fold: the fact of addition givH way to a kind of multiple division or subtraction that enriches itself with zeros " it rac+ breathlHsly toward the infinite. "More" and "less" are only separateźunited by the iƶnitesimal inconsistency, the next-to-nothing of the hymen. This play of the integral unit excrescent with zeros, "sums, by the hundreds and $yond," is demonstrated by Mallarme under the tide of ] [this word is mth a noun signining "Gold" and a conjunction marking a turning:int in an argument.-TKns.] (ex.n " he w" in alloying-in the liteþ alchemy of such an ironic, precious, and overinƐated signi<er-the sensir ble, phonetic, gKphic, economic, logic, and syntactic vinu+ of this stone in which the "two ways, in all, in which oǛ need is biƔrcated: +thetics on the one hand and also:litical economy" intersect (p. 3P; cf. also p. 656)): "OR...

Why dus this almost-nothing lose the glint of a phenomenon? Why is there no phenomenology of the hymen? Because the antre in which it folds back, as little in order to conceal itself as in order to denude itself, is also an abyss. In the recoiling of the blank upon the blank, the blank colors itself, ' +com®for itself, of itself, aecting itself ad inTnitum-its own color less, ever more invisible, ground. Not that it is out of reach, like the phenomenological horizon of 6rception, but that, in the act of inscribing itself on itself indeTnitely, mark upon mark, it multiplies and complicatB its text, a text within a text, a margin in a mark, the one indeTnitely rep¨ted within the other: an abyss.

THE DOUBLE SESSION  sWn  one  Ⱦognized, Łom all the disseminated webs, the fold of the hymen-with all that this supplement is hencefonh woven ofƜne hǙ rFd not only the "nubile folds" in the TĭbTu Ù V)`ine but also the endless multiplication of folǧ, unfoldings, foldouts, foldur;, folders, ɀ manifolds, along with the pli;, the ploys, and the multi-plications. Every determinate fold unfolds the <gure of another (from the leaf to the sheet, from the sheet to the shroud, from the &d to the ook, from the linen to the vellum, from the wing to the fan, from the veil to the dancer, to the plumes, to the lFǾer, etc.) and of the re-m@k of this fold-u7n-itself of writing. It would & eHy to verił the Ȳeceding demonstration for the 7lysemy of the fold: under the constraints of the diIerential supplementary stœcture, which constantly adds or withdraws a fold from the series, no 7ssible theme of the fold would & able to constitute the system of its meaning or pȿent the unity of its multiɼicity. If the4 we4 no fold, or if the fold had a limit somewheԿՀ limit other than itself  a mark, margin, or march (thr;hold, limit, or [rderƁ-the4 would & no text. But if the text drs not, to the letter, exist, then tğ is %rhaps a text. A text one must make tracks with... Iɽ ¢here we4 n¡ te t, the4 uld %rhaȳ & some uɾimaginable felicity of exp4sston, but there would no doubt & no literature. If literaturĺ-the literature Mallarme still prLuces under that nUe, allow ing for the re=zations set fonh a[ve concerning "literarity" (the essence or truth of literatureƃ-is engaged in this fold of a fold, then it is not a mere subsection of foldedness: it can give its name to anything that resists, within a given history, the puȹ and simple a[lishing of the fold. Any thing that resists &ing used  an example: ǖe Mall@mean <gu4 of the ǿld, for eɨmple, enables us to join the erotic to the sensible, then to the reµexive, to the metaphysical, and to the literary: the fold is at once sex, foliage, mirror, ook, 9d tomǞǟll @e rFlities it gathers up into a cenain veh s%cial d4U of intimacy. (Richard, p. 28)
But the fold is not a form of reµexivity. If by reµexivity one means the motion of conscioness or self-p4sence that plays such a determining role in Hegel's s%culative logic and dialectic, in the movement of sublation (Auॉebung) and negativity (the essence is reµktion, says the greater Ͷgic), then 4µexivity is but an eIkt of the fold  text. In a chapter called Rࢳivi̳, Rich@d analyz; the fold along the dialectical, totalizing, eudemonistic lines we have already questioned. He turns the fold, so to speak, only in the di4ction of the "veh s%cial d4U of intimacy," toward

THE DOUBLE SESSION 27 1 the þsezed, protected, "mLest" insides of =lf-consciousness ("Conscious of itself, intimacy &comes reexivity"):
To reect intellectually is already to fold in u7n oneself... The folding-back al½ protects a secret dimension of the object; it þsezes an inside for &ing.... The fold is %»ect then &cau= intimBy can dwell there in [th the security and the equality of the exact adequa tion of two saՋ, and in the shimmering, the Btive consciousness, [rn of the encounter &tween two otɍs. EBh self 7ss;ses itself in 9 other it nonetheless knows to & only another self. At the farthest reach ofHerLiade's n@cissism, 9d doubtless even more %»ect than that &cause it would intrLuce into the reexive circuit the exciting presence of pseudo-otherness, there exists %rhaps in Mall@me the temptation, entirely on the mental level, of what would elsewhere & called homosexuality.... Within the folded objectƝok, &d, wing-the intimate space annuls itseȕ with so much intimBy: the self and its image are no longer =rated, H in a mirror, by any distance. (Pp. 177-78)
Even sup7sing that the mirror drs unite the self with its image, this analysis, while not in truth unjusti´able, deli&rately 9d unilaterally closes the fold, inteɄrets it H a coincidence with self, makes o%ning into the precondition of షlf-ç±tion, 9d reduces every way in which the fold also marks dehiscence, dissemination, spBing, tem7riɬtion, etc. This confirms the clHsical reading of MallaŒe and confines his text within 9 atmosphere of intimism, sym[lism, 9d neo-Hegelianism.
Dissemination in the folds of the hymen: that is the "o%ration.·· Its steps allow for (no) Fthĕ: no th leads aroŚd in a circle toward a first step, nor prGeeds from the simple to the complex, nor leads from a &ginning to an end ("a ook neither &gins nor ends: at most it pretends to" [the "BWk" 1 8 1 (A)}).

In the Not& and D¨uÞts that follow the chapter entitled T¯ard a Dlñ৫s ofToϳli̳, Richard fans out the array offeathers (including the fan) in a series of pages of g4at &auty, moving from their angelic (seraphic) value to their "Luciferi9, or at le(t Promethean, signi<cation" (p. ŋ5). Near the end of this extensive note (which is almost four pages long), following a parenthetical remark concerning the "phallic allusion" that Ro&n Greer Cohn "sees in the feather," Rich@d expresses some mistrust of a cenain extension of 7lythematicism. Here is his justi<cation: "For the word pluF [feather} h( also &en understú to & the pluF [%n} of the ɧit³, and it is ȫrticularly u7n this analogy that R. G. Cohn  founded his whole exegesis.

Why should a "literal allego©" & "contra© to the genius ofMallarme"? What is Mallarme's genius? ǧ the idea of a "literal allego©" imply a mono=my that would 4duce all quills to the writer's %n? But Cohn is conducting a completely different o%ration: he is establishing a network that also ̪Ê through the "phallic allusion." (Interestingly, despite the proximity of his references, Rich@d dissGiates thǴ'phallic allusion" by putting it in parentheses, and dissGiates ¦¨her from that "allusion" the critical paragraph we have just quoted.) Then, tW, what is ĵ "excessively conceptual analogy"? Why should what is "Ñssible" & improbable? What is the nature of a prWf of thematic affinity? Even without quoting the whole textual m(s whose network Cohn displays (and which would provide us with qu(i-certainty if recour=  such norms  any %rtinence here), why wouldn't the text cited ( a "however"-which confirms at lôt once7' the Ñssibility in questioȜgive us 3n enough to supÑ= that the writer's quill is always, on how¥er virtual a level, implied and implicated in the cloth, wing, or tissue of ¥ery other kind of feather?

These plays (on "plume," on "winds," etc.) are anathema to any lexi cological summation, any taxonomy of themes, any deciphering of mean ings. Bur precisely, the crisis oflirerarure, rhe "exquisite crisis, down ro rhe foundations," is mïked in a corner of this c(r-oI excess. The figure of the cପ) (le coin], with which we &gan, would testił ro this in all the 4c(tings and rerem%rings that have marked irs course (9 angle, an o%n 4cess, a fold, a hymen, a metal, a monetary signiĿer, a seal, a su%rim7si tion of marks, ere.). The coin-enm. If this crisis is indeed one of veɅe, ir is <rst and foremost &cause rhe formal structure of the rexr, which is called ̴e in Mallarme's logical generalization of ir, is precisely what historically organizes, with the omission of rhe author ōlD je), just such a form of excess. Ir  often &en ɍid rhar Mallarme, without apparently having made many acĀal innovations in this domain, constructed his entire literary prðis our of rhe nec;sities of verse and rhyme: rhar is, once th;e two concepts have &en tr9sformed and generalized, upon 4%rcsions set oI Uong signi<ers, which  in no way dictated or decided in advance by any thematic intentionality. Rhymĺ-which is rhe general law of textual eIectā-is the folding-together of an identity and a diIerence. The raw material for this o%ration is no longer merely the sound of rhe end of a word: all "substances" (phonic and graphic) 9d all "forms" can & linked roger her ar any dis ranee and under any Āle in order ro prLuce new versions of "that which in discourse drs nor speak." For diIerence is rhe nec;sary intezal, rhe sus%nse &tween two outcomes, rhe "lapse of rime" &tween two shots, two rolls, rwo chances. Without irs &ing 7ssible in advance to ĉiA the limits of this son of propagation, a diIerent eIect is prLuced Fch time, an eIect that is therefore each rime "new" [neuƪ, a game Ǘeu] of chance forever new, a play of <re ſu] forever young [jǹȞɲ-<re and gam; &ing always, ( Heraclitus and Nietɮche have said, a play of luck with necessity, of contingency with law.

Literature is at once re(sured and threatened by the fBt of de%nding only on itself, standing in the air, all alone, (ide from Being: "and, if you will, alone, excepting everything."
Thus: rhythm, decline, inclined cadence, decadence, faR and return: "For, ever since that white creature ce(ed to &, strangely and singularly, I have loved everything summed up in the word: fall.

THE DOUBLE SESSION
ÚÛ tion, a scene without a 4ferent. In all th4e c(es, moreover, the music 4sezed for that o%ning s7t consists in p4parations for a Ŀnale: the evening in Mimique ("Silence, sole lĄuɈ after rhymes, an orch;tra only marking with its gold, its brush; with thought and dusk... "), the "sunsets" in Or, and the winter ĳernWn in Crise A ן, s%nt in a gl(sed-in library with its closed ookshelves from which one h( read all the ooks, shelf after shelf of old-f(hioned literature, a "swishing of brGhures" in a wintry atmosphe4 of icy %r and of o%n tombs, during a storm %rceived through the pane of a window, a tem%st swn from inside a gl(s: "Just now, letting myself go, with the l(situde prLuced by one dispiriting afternWn of # wFther after 9other, I let drop, without curiosity Ŕemingly ȃving read everything twenty yeaɇ ago, the Łinge of multicolored pFrls that smWths the in, again, u7n the swishing of brGhures in the library. M9y a work, &neath the &aded gl(s curtain, will line up its own scintillation: I love to follow, ( in a ri%ned sky, ǚainst the gl(s, the play of lights of a storm" (p. 360). In an illusion of lights 9d swishings, you will almost have Ŕen, in a burst of lightning, what a Ɏintillation  (hed by-by him who seems to have read it all. Unless it (he) h( ined (reigned).
Like Mimique ( 188Ѣ1891-1897) and like Or, Crise A Ðs com7s; its transformations in thrw &ats ( 188Ѣ1892-1896). Ǎong the thrw ĳer nWns, the fabric is veh tightly woven. In Pag& ( 1891), what is to &come the <rst paragraph of Mimique follows two other pǛagraphs &giȢing thus: "Winter is for prȩ. "With the splendor of aut¾n, כա côes.... "Silence, sole lĄuh Ĳter rhymes.... " (P. 340)
In this atmosphere &s%aking the end of history, the exhausted librah plays out, swishing, all its Òales; during the ú, it is swept away and yet protected by the thin transrent c(ing of a pane of gl(s [હ), by the fortun; of a verse [Ðs) or hymen; it is threatened with &ing Ften away from the inside." The pane of gl(s, which sezes ( [th an insulator and a 77.

THE DOUBLE SESSION contît &tween the library and the turmoil, reAects all Mallarme's other windows and mirrors, 9d aIords a view, inside, of"many a work, &neath the &aded gls cu¨ain." Beads [જot)ie]: little bits of minutely worked נt (or ɢs) strung together like fragile ºms, a "fringe" of"multicolored %arls," like a work that "will line up its own scintillation." A[lished Ǡubl. A ptyx.
A sampling of fFthers (and) of gls in ĳ DǱiǵe MoA [The ¢t&t Fbhion] will retem%r the swishing alloy made out of winter and gls: "Brôtplates, bces, corselets, etc., the whole charming, defensive getup that  long %zaded feminine attire will not diɏontinue the u= of jet, with its steely scintillations, nor abandon steel itself, either. While not neglecting the rich array of feathers: natural rȧter, peacGk, 9d pheHant feathers along with ostrich plumes ½metimes dyed blue or pink, we havǻ continued to &lieve (he4 our predictions diIer from tho= of others) that for the length of the winter the of sequins, Ǣs, 9d metal will go on" (p. 832).
All this intimate space, however, =als itself oI only so  to remark a ce¨ain historical storąthe crisiā-the <nal inanity of that of which there will n¥er again & quite ɒ much. It is the end and re%tition of a year, a cycle, a ring. And the return of a rhythm: "Chimera, to have thought of that attests, through the reAection of its scales, to what extent the present cycle or lt quarter centuh is undergoing ½me absolute strike of light ning-whose disheveled showers running down my windows wh îross the stÜing turmoil, until it ill¾inates thisƙthat, more or ls, all ooks contain the ¦sion of a few num&red rephrHings: and there might even & but onóin the world its law-bible  it is simulated by each nation" (p. 367).
I thus &gan to sprinkle the crisis of veÿ with splinte divǶse: with sliɤ of glǜs, with bits of Ȯrl, with "ʃhiIs of mystǷ," with icy "winds" 9d dispiriting weath³, with libraries and ȷn in wint³ [hiÐೣ೤hilÐ, winlt³, the ½unds reftect, repeat, and condense the opposition in which they ¯ found (ƭR [Crise de Vࣸ]), the function of the deÒriptive bîkin a th9ter I...

THE DOUBLE SESSION groŚd %riLically bkoming an element in the abyss, a decor made to V carried away by re%tition, made to engage there the whole of the library, the literature of ytehear [hi)}, missing the V of the hymen. In order to =t up the library Vhind CriseĤ ʻ, the "author" hH oIered us its "bibliography." The Bibliographie ap%nded to Divagatio notes: "Crise Ĥ Ðs, a study from the Natiodl Obsࣾ), 4including some pHsages omitted from Vartiଝ: the fragment 'An undeniable desi4 in my time... ' ap%ared serately in Pag&." The Pleiade editors add: "The <rst three paragraphs of Crise Ĥ Ðs reprLuce: 1. the o%ning lines of one of the V@iations on a Subject, which appeared in the įptemVr 1, 1895, issue of ¢ R˿ue b͞n(he under the title: VIII, AÐs& ou Critique [DoϾtuɡ Ģ CritiȾsm}.... "
The word Aʻ& thus o%rates like a hidden line linking the crisis of literature to the crisis of criticism, to rain, to winter, to the storm, to the ௏̱l of the golden age. A seHonal cycle with seHonable wFther. Winter facts ੤aits d'hiÐ: sounds like faits diÐs, "news items," the title of another of Mall@me's series of @ticles.-Trans.}. Mall@me wH unlikely to miss the channel running Vtween a̴e 9d the English word ʻe, not only Vcause that second language is always su%rim7sed in some way on his syntð and vGabulĶ78 but also Vcae Cɟse Ĥ ʻ wH originally pub lished in the Natiಘl Obsँ. Like the Gra૧ Fails Diʻ [G°t Nps
Itó} (in which Or is found).
The crisis of the alternative, of the binary op7sition, of the ̴m ÿ), is th inscriVd in an atmosphere of death and 4birth, 9 atmȨphere [th ¦nereal and joyous. It is a moment of wake¦lness [¦iRe}, a wake for the dead, an awakening of birth, a watch [¦ille} and an eve (ಠɸe}, a hymen Vtween yesterday 9d tomorrow, a waking wet79 drFm on the eve of now. 78. is is not jTt a biog;phical Kct.

The Hoqge to Wagner is teetering there, tW. Here, the mortal remains are those of Victor Hugo. But in [th texts we <nd the same structure, the sUe words, the sUe veil and fold and "a little bit, its rending." The sUe underside worn through, traversed, 4versed, versified, diversi<ed. In a hymen de%nding on the verse, blank once more, com7sed of ch9ce and necessity, a con<guration of veils, folds, and quills, writing prepares to receive the =minal spu¨ of a throw of dice.

The mirror in which these Numb)s ac r8d, in its caÓcity for seeing you, will of coue  broken, but it will reĄect that breaking in a Mction that remains intact and uninterrupted.
If "this" moment in the Mction comZ ck to itself, %ks itself aYut its own 2wer, and attempts a p%sage toward the other, it can therefore only do Ė by Mtting itself into the anglZ tween the su×aces of NumȽ, along the line of an o(ning/dosing (since angles o(n and close at once), in the inteǛsur)tce of the sÔces that are already Mlled and prescrid by NumȽ, in (the) place of the articulation tween one su¦ce and another, one ten+ and another.

What Ėrt of angle is this angle writing? concave? projecting? an angle of reÊstion?

The im2ssibility is practι0.
What is to  said aYut this prƀis? If to prxuce is to draw out of darkn`s, to bring to light, to unveil or to manifest, then this "practice" dNs not content itself with the act of making or prxucing. It cannot be governed by the motif of truth whose very horizon it fraȋ, for it is just % rigorously accountable for nonprxuction, vr o¥rations of nullification and deduction, and for the workings of a cerǲin textual zero. 2. 9e Apparatus or Feme "It is thG weights and mŅuĦ, these f.mň, t΄ meridiaĎ, and thG ̓iͳcî hϭizoĎ which, in their veÆ cotђction, ԙԚs a kind of rigor that is aõolute Sd geϊ.l, ŔtomatΛal."
Within the system of this st@nge countable p@ctice, the one who is ultimately accountable, the single, unique accountant, will  no less than the reader, or even the author, whom you will not  in a 2sition to name.

At the Ǯme time, in this very gZture, they þsign a determiwte place to what they take apart, granting it a relative position within the general movement of the apparatus. Cl%sically s(aking, this place would  that of illusion and error, about which Spinoza and Kant have demonst@ted, along Ôths that are % di?erent % one could wish, that it is not enough to come aware of them in order for them to ce to Ënction. Such moments of awareness long in the categoO of theatrical effects. One might even, prudently, take the analogy Ërther, whether in the direction of the illusion necessaO for (rception, inherent in the very stÙcture of sensible presentation, or in the direction of a transcendental illusion at play within the veO law that constitutes the object, that presents the thing % an object, % that which stands op2site me, tcing me. C In the ५aF of the text, one side of the squŽ, one surface of the cu will reprƜȃ! this nonempirical error, this traǌendental illusion] More simply put, it will XϢBt: it will be the o(ning to tư cl%sical reprZentative scene. In representing repcsentation, it will reƪect and plain it in a very singular mirror. It will s(ak representation, pro?ering its discourse through a kind of "square mouth," "oblivion closed by the fre. " You will celessly  required to take this structural illusion into account. You should remark here only that it dNs not arise % an arrant error, an uncontrollable dikrientation, or a capricioW contingency of desire. On the contraO, it   to long to a necessity iǋcrid in situ, within the overall organiÜtion and calculable Ënctioning of the to2gra phy, so that the theater can Mnally succeed in ing cruelly generalized, so that no nonplace whatsNver is le out of it, k that no pure origin (of creation, of the world, of the word, of ex(rience, of all that is pre+nt in general) can stand gǷd over the stage % if derived from the intactness of some absolute opening. If that which, once it is framed, ap(ars to  an element or an Ucurrence of o(ning is no longer anything but an a(Vure e?ect that is to2logically %signable, then nothing will indeed have taken place but the place.
Out. Any attempt to return toward the untouched, pro(r intimacy of some presence or some self-presence is played out in illusion. Because illusion, % its name already implies, is always an e?st of play; and also cause illusion entails a thƕter in which a certain deMnite relation tween the unrepresentable and reprZentation is engaged. And l%tly cause the whole of the text, % in Draq, is through and through put into play, Õwerfully reinstituting the square horizontality ofthe page, ofthe "check erYard se¨ing % a Mgure for time," of that "invisible chessƈd," within the theatrical volume of a certain cu.

Not that the apparatW can be considered my self or my pro(ny, but it stands in my place and I is only the diuerentiated stÙcture of tƱs organiÜtion, which is abklutely natural and purely artificial, diuerentiated enough to count within its structure the moment or the place of the autarchic illusion or the sovereign subject.
This apparatW explains it+lf. Its self-explawtoriness dNs not imply, however, that one can explain it, that it can  comprehended by an outside ob+¨er: rather, it itself explains it+lf and alÖdy comprehends any ob+¨er whatever.

The latter dNs not merely plain it+lf; it alk « its eȂlawtion, which is not some discourse emŻting from somewhere el+ that would, outside the text, come to comment, inteØret, decipher (you e ginning to understand why this tt is undecipherable), t8ch, or inform aYut the technical secrets of its %semblage.

P make some incision, some violent arbitraj cut, aƬer you recall that Numÿs actually prescris such ©issions, and rsommends "ginning" with one. It is of course a ginning that is forever Gctiowl, and the scission, gr from ing an inaugural act, is dictated by the absencÅ-unless there exists some illusion to discountŅf any de-cisive ginning, any pure event that would not divide and reďat itself and alcady refer ck to some other "ginning," some other "event," the singularity of the event ing more mythical than ever in the order of discoue. Scission is necessaj cause of the fact (or  a consequence of the fact, as you will) that the ginning is plied and multiplied aYut itself, elusive and divisive; it gins with its own division, its own numeroWness.

You did not in?ct cut jJt anything or just anywher. The sequence you cut is the "Grst" in a series of 25 sequences (aring the num(r 4. It is the fourth in a )t containing 100: the "o%ration" $ it is called by the dip%aring author of the text cited akve $ an epigraph, the o%ration of reading-writing, with no subject or object but the Eok.
The text's chan will have (en played. It will have stated the present $ a cut, a scission, an interruption of the text put into play in the text. But it is in the prsent that it will have stated the pre)ntness of the scission. For nothing says the prsent (tter, it )eð, than tğ is. But what tğ is here is a scission ("there is this scission"), and what is "ࠈౖntly ÅBt and at Ȟk" is a "Ăil."
Which is Ùso to ( underst $ the recoil of a r5rm and the

Constituting one of the?ces of the 25 ćuPs (which are doubly n(red: in %riic mhion, from 1 to 4, and in lin5r mhion, from 1 to 100), it is the o%ning àä out in the form of a scene that is at this very moment visible and v]al, speaking to the sôtator-reader: "you."

Numŝs, reading you, seeing you, speaking to you, in the pr]eĈ of reading, seeing, speaking; "in the pĀess" here meaning "at the moment in which presently" you ¨, )e, s%ak, etc. You live in the present, in "what is called present," in consciousness; you witns what seems to ( in front of you, what is upright (fore you, advancing toward you, what stands out against the ve< horizon of the world, (comes a gure against that ground, takes sha% $ it faces you, exõ)d and exÚinable (fore your eyes, your brow, your mouth, your hands.

This scission, this odning, is pure apdarance of apdaring through which the present qems to free itself from the textual machin("histoo," num3rs~ toelogy, dissemination, etc.) in |cAenounces itselcat every moment. jThe odration puts "illusion" into play 1 an eEect or pr`uct. "Presence," or "pluction," is but a pluct.@he pr`uct of an arithmetic odration)The apparent immediacy of what qems to 3 given to pr?ent drception in its original nakedness, in its nature, _is alr;dy shed 1 an eFct; it falls:%nder the sway of a machinated stncturbthat never gives itself away i[to the present, which h1 nothing to do with it. Nor should the imdrfect, the tenq of the other three series of sequences ( 1, 2, 3), 3 read 1 an otĞ preqnt, a m`iGed preqnt, a p1t preqnt, the p1t of what once at le1t ` present, uen some other sukce one Xght once have seen arising 3fore one, and which one might still 3 able to see if one were to m/e the rounds of the th;ter or of one's memoo, of the theater of memory (one should read within the layers of Numb)s the qdimentation of all sorts of arts of memoo, of all the "theaters of memory" and all the plans that designed them, from the Ad H)ennium to the Ars દoiae by Ro3rt Fludd, including the projects of Giulio Camillo, Giordano Bruno, etc.). The imdrfect is thereHre not another present, a h1-3en-preqnt; it is another thing entirely than the present; it aÛ no essence. That is why it "prխiࠨs the motion and the un஡c/bԹ  uble Õttom." The present presents itqlf 1 the simplicity of a 5ttom or ground. A p1t tenq that would mark only another present would 1sure itqlf of the grounding of a simple foundation, hidden 3hind the sukce of preqnt apdarances. What the double 5ttom of the imdrf>t summons up, here at l<t, is a time without grounding, foundation, or limit, a tense that would no longer 3 a tpD; it is a presentless time, the total account depriving the square of its ground, l;ving it susdnded in the air. As sbn 1 there is a double 5ttom, there is no bottom or ground at all in pr_ess of formation, and this law will not c= to conGrm itself from now on. The imdrfect will have provided the motion.

THE DOUBLE BOTTOM OF THE PLUPRESENT 309 also denounced, _ you can s`, and set in motion by the touch of a whip "with thongs of st`l. " But that denunciation tak place in a Ăuence that is itself written in the present.
What about this new present? Why and how is this fourth sequence at the saF time a "preWntation" and a critical discourse, a summons addressed to "you" concerning the pĊsentation? Why dƑs this conĘatory interpreta tion, which constantly refers back to the imdrfƁt, remain in the present? And what is its relation to the imdrfect which provides the motion? Perhaps it h_ to do with some unknown mirror. You aĳ getting hot _ you approŵh that icy lpking gl_s and the key to a cenain cl_p. This new preWnt is more drceptible in the odning of the Draą. Its story w_ apá஺tly written in the prent.  co£se. In that way, tp, it can + found reinsened, transplanted, re-cited, with all the e}ects of textđ trnsformation this implies, within the more encomp_sing set and the more complex temUrality of Numŝs. You will have many a chance to veriÁ this. But the Draą's preWnt w_ nĭer in fact simple. In the st¡cture of the I Ching, on the checkerɧd, +tw`n the present outside the quotation marks and the present of what "he writ," a disjuncture cr`ps in, a duplicity in which something abysmal hapdns to the founding present, to what is called preWnt. Following this "dčlity triggered o} by writing," there is thus alrPdy, on the ÿe page, a simple present, the eįƁt prjuced by what provides the motion, and the preƛnt that enounc or denounces its relation to the other tenă in a "scientific" disco£se, "scientiƈc" in its preWntation, which tells, in the prent, the t¡th (asut truth _ a naive present). Jet _ in sequence fo£ of Numŝs.
This total, di}eĳntiated, equivaal present, which must not + reduced to the simple present it violently throws into question; this st¡ctured, sttomls present, which is related to the double bottom that compre hends but is not the present, is called, in Draą, the "plupresent" ["p/ª que-p௢Bt"J.
Although it is neither squarely the imdrfect in Numŝs, nor the double or dialogic prent of the founh interdllation, the pluprent will have laid the groundwork for sth of these: it will, through a kind of future drfect Vutur antȄieur], have ljged itself in the one and in the other, or Ɨther in the veI exchange through which they were supposed to "remark" each other. Such a ture drfect, always making one text circulate inside another, exclud any and all eschatology merely by dint of +ing the future dƙect of an innumerable imdrfect, an indeƈnite p_t that will never have +en present.

You have just, through this quotation, through this motiffrom Dra>, come within sight of a "horizon which dƒ and dus not exist," and then of a ce°ain "screen. " You are almost there.
P one ought to have invented "something that would signiÀ the incessant or the innumerable. " Inventing it, of coue, in the inteĴal. Inventing the sign for this "+ing-in-the-praess-of," for a movement that is at once uninterrupted and broken, a continuity of rifts that would neverthels not İatten out along the suƙace of a homogeneous, obvioĎ present. Oś language always takes up this movement in the form of a +coming-present: to +come present, a prent in the pras of +coming, the +coming of the present, a reprise of the movement of writing in the tense of"living" s6ech: a self-pralaimed tracels present. It wS therefore necessaI to turn to what is outside our langƟge in order to signiÁ that incessant extrapresent. And what is outside sp`ch, tæ. Two "Chineƛ" cacters mark that "something cotantly ϥni>t0 and udpp࢏0-  -"( 1. 3 7), that incessant movement of the " being in the pr¨ɇs of and pr࢒isely -

THE DOUBLE BOTTOM OF THE PLUPRESENT 3 1 1
The plupresent in sequence four thus envelops both the present ("lived," by you, in the "illusion" of one who lives, reads, speaks in the present, your eyes riveted to the cl&sical scenůio) and its violent reinscription in the theatrical, arithmetical machine: Nums, read, s, and sAak, you, in the prdess of rïding you, seeing you, speaking (to) you, "in the prdess" here meaning at the moment that, non-presently, you are "ing rïd, seen, s7ken, etc. This reinscription tak& plĨe; th¤ is its violence. This "there is" of the "taking place" is in the prFent only through the "illusions" of statement or utterance. The content and act of this sAech are immediately oAn u7n the extraprFent. What takes place, what theû is, is writing, i.e. a machination in which the pǄent is no longer anything but a whirligig. Thus it is that Dra> will have put the present in place in writing, in the taking-place of the place, in the ex-centered com7sition of the pluprFent: "His story is no longer his stoO, but simply this statement: something takes place. He triF to "come the center of this new silence, and indeed ƈeOthing comF up and "comes hesitant and unbalanced in his vicinity... S7ken words and gestures ("side him, outside) rediscover their geometric rats: he enters into a generalized graph."
The machination of tenses, in Nums, mergF with the distribution of Arsons. For example (what else can you do here but pick an example out of the innumerable or draw a lot?), the "we" will no more have "en just a Arson among others than the imArfect a simple p&t presƆt. The "we" is the nonpresent, nonAronal, imArfect, limitless element in which the Arsonal present, the proArnFs of the Arsons you, /, he, we are cutting out, cut themselvF out. The "we" is but the place of the Armutation of Arsons. Hence it takes place & the "dawning indication of an unsităted-unsitu ablƁ-presence, but which remains and reconstitutes itself irresistibly. There is doubtlFs noŷy there, but the roles are Armuted... " That is why the other Arons prFent themselves, frontally so to sAak, and can " faced, counted, discounted; the "we" is never presented ñll face: the imArfect or plupresent: "I.... Yet ̘nwhile, th¤ was a 'n. ' This 'n' got lt, caF òk, tஶblO, and k˹t coming øck... " Everything h& thus ""gun" by that "we" and yet it is never representable at the front of the scene.

DISSEMINATION whatever pre«nts itself. While we remain attentive, f^inated, glued to what presents itself, we are unable to see Åence ] such, since presence ds not pre«nt itself, no mo¡ than ds the visibility of the visible, the audibility of the audible, the medium or "air," which disappears in the act of allowing to ap.
But it is not enough to call presence to mind, to make the air itse÷ apr, supposing that to ` ssible, in order to e e forgetfulnjs, illusion, or error. For not only is the air not a simple medium-nor is the "air" (this will ` remem`red since one can only say it, not si it) a unival signiqcation-but the oning c\ed out of it is in oct a closed oning, neither quite on nor quite clo«d.8 is false exit. A Rirroy And it is not j¶t any mirror. It sPould ` added that this mirror will have `en turned tow[d the back of the stage, "toward the other three sidj," opering ã only the sight of its tain, in sum.
Which would (not) ` aēthing if the tain were not also transparent, or rather transformative of what it lets show through. The tain in this mirror thus resects-im¢ectly-what comes to it-im¢ectly-from the other thri walls and lets througy-presently-the ghost of what it resects, the shadow deformed and reformed according to the rgure of what is cYled prkent: the upright qxity of what stands `fore me; "the iciptio... appTr i્0, right0, ӳ0."
Once this ether, the prlnce of the present,   ƅƆ called to mind, i t is necessa§ to mark the fact that the pluprjent is not merely ÅBce, but also a kind of deformation irreducible to any forĆćnd hence to any pre«nt+ transformation b]ed on no original form, no raw material, no qrst matter in the l]t instance. To mark this is to rem[k that the alleged simplicity of the oning, of the arity-the letting-`, the t¥th that lifts the veil screen-is already regulated according to a mirror, and in panicular a rainljs mirror, or at any rate a mirror who« rain lets "images" and "£ons" through, endowing them with a certain index of transformation and rmutation.
Nums are of such a c]t: their ink is drawn from this tXn, a sort of metal covered with liquid mercu§ (the 10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, which is the num`r of the lett) in the Kabbalah and of the Sphinx in Tarot, is also the num`r of M)cué in ]trology and thje Nums qlled with "q±si stel`r souఉ' could be rfd, will sn `gin to ` read, ] an ]trographical constellation). The mercury, the tain of this ink, forms a scrin. It shelte£ and concfls. Holds in rese¦e and exses to view. The screen: at once the visible projection surface for imagj, and that which prevents one from seeing the other side.

What remains to c done is to smKh this mirror to smithereens" (quoted in LogiҪ).
It is hźd to know whether such a mirror is the space of the clKsical stage or the generalized sÕce, irreducible and plupreWnt, in which the old thPter is inscricd, dismantled, and denounced. This ƠcertainĎ should not c dis6lled. The mirror and the extramirror, the implication and the issƟnce, źe together prescricd by the structure of this unce°ain s6cu lum.

DISSEMINATION than itself. The element envelops and deducts itself from what it envelops. The world comprehends the mirror which captures it and vice versa. In the whole of what it captures, and 0cause it can capture the whole, each part of the mirror is larger than the whole; but then it is smaller than itself. The fourth surface is the pzadigm of this relation, which dgs not prent it from 0ing caught in it itself; & the mirroring eect of the whole, & present, it re-forms, in the indeQniteness of the plupresent, all possible deformations.

And since nothing h& preceded the mirror, since eHthing 0gins in the folds of citation (you will later lezn how to r1d this word), the inside of the text will always have ·en outside it, in what seems to 0 se¤ing & the "m1ns" toward the "work." This "recipr>al contyination of the work and the m1ns" poisons the inside, the ïy pro8r of what w& once called the "work," jt & it poisons the texts which  cited to ap8ar and which one would have liked _to k|p safe from this violent expatriation, this upr~ting abstraction that wrenches them out of the security of their original context. Interestingly enough, in Numîs, poison is af¼rmed. The mercuH in its tain is a poison. It is mentioned by nye, a name whoI frequent >curence you will have ·en able to follow: "dé po~on, " "subtl) po~on, " "FthOical poison, " "a m̢ Sࣘt, * po~onO bl¯, " "the poison I Ɍ ɞognizO in my ¦i, " "letting the oppite of the FÁl coF ɏ, soFthing poisonO and slୀ , " "the <ient... trafìí ½ its ¨ciҳt, but in tuģ not l«ెing the latt) intact, iՖltrating it and tisoning it in its sentBc&, " etc. The relation 0ĩ|n opposing terms, 0tw|n contraH germs, is th one of venomous tain. Metals of course can well 0, and 0 termed, "venomo."
To tH to resist the removal of a textual mem0r from its context is to want to remain protected against this writing poison. It is to want at all costs to maintìn the boundaH line 0tw|n the inside and the outside of a context. It is to recognize the legitimacy of the relative s8ci¼city of 1ch text, but it is also to 0lieve that any system of writing exists in itseí, & the relation of an inside to itself, panicularly when it is "tYe.

The mirror of a mirror. Witns this description, already, in Draä, and store up in your memoI each one of its details, for instance those columê of white smoke rising asve the factories. tter, you will alrPdy have rPd: "There is a tranquillity there composed of words that are falW and lacking in importance, a frozen rotation in which, while I am _l`p, I live through my own disappƀance (and I Ÿ sorI, I insist: asut the total dest¡ction of my hand and the põcisely symmetrical dest¡ction of your eyes and mine).

And that is where the problem lies: how is one to follow the solicitations, the apëls, the diagonal lin of such rapid visions ('fern' is also the pr¯nce of the hidden sun, the car6t of luminous ¸tterns in which all autumns come to + imprinted), unless it + through a system of reİection and framing which makes the rest exist and which, in its re6titions and closur, sets it fr`?

You would + mistaken to think that the matrix of NϹs is merely outlined in Draä, barely sketched out by that "scr`n," those "diagonal lines," that "system of reİection and framing which makes the rest exist and which, in its re6titions and closures, sets it free," that "right angle," that "wall," that "mirror," that "lag."

"
The screen, without which there would 3 no writing, is also a device descri3d in writing. The writing pr>ess is reected in what is wriccen. And here is another scr^ē, a "provisiool ¥r^n," another matrix of the "o7ration, " caught in another of DraÀ's textu refractions, another citation you will have r1d all the way down to the citation of another mirror within it: "He lives in this countH, this city...

Imagine Plato's cave not simply overthrown by some philosophical move ment but tĖsformed in its entihty into a circumscri3d f1 contained within another¤n absolutely other-stYcture, an incommensurably, unpredictably more complicated machine. Imagine that mirrors would not 3 in the world, simply, included in the totality of all onta and their images, but that things "prLent," on the contraH, would 3 in th. Imagine that mirroV (shadows, reections, phant&ms, etc.) would no longer 3 coૄ ʞҲ within the strucĨre of the ontology and myth of the caם-which also situates the scr^n and the mirror-but would ther envelop it in its entirety, prćucing here or there a particular, extremely determinate eect. The whole hierarchy descri3d in the Republic, in its cave and in its line, would once again Qnd itSelf at stake and in question in the theater of NϹs.
Without >cupying it entirely, the "Platonic" moment inhabits the fourth suĘace. But the foĮh surface also comprehends, & you know, the discouVe that dismantles the "Platonic" order of presence (present s7ã l1ding us to the visibiliĪ of the phenomenon, to the visibility of the eiĝ, of what is, in its tYth, 3hind the veil or screen, etc.).

THE ATTENDING DISCOURSE of aid, of indefatigable attentiveness, of vigilant pr¥ention, a kind of Platonic błtheia that supports with its s%ech-its present s%ech-the faltering and frightened in´rmity of an ekgonos, a dis7sseŖed son, a stray prLuct, a seed ex7sed to Ĵl the violence of writing: you).
The attending discoursǭ-which is prolifeting heȼ-is addɀɁ to the s%ctator (who attends the s%ctacle and is c@efully attended in his attendance) and Hsists him in his reading of the moving stœctɠ of the play H a whole in all of its foɟ faces, in its generalized writing and its total account in prGess of formation.
But who is it that is addrǸsing you? Since it is not an "author," a "ıĲtor," or a "de ex machina," it is an "I" that is [th part of the s%ctacle and rt of the audience; an "I" that, a bit like "you," attends (underg¹s) its own inceɓt, violent reinscription within the @ithmetical machineh; an "I" that, Ȁctioning H a pure pHsageway for o%rations of substitution, is not some singul@ and irreplacFble existence, some subject or "life," but only, moving &tween life and dFth, rǯity and ´ction, etc., a meȻ ¦nction or phantom. A term and a germ, a teŒ that disseminates it=lf, a germ that carries its own term within it. Strengthening its brFth with its dFth. The swd is sFled; the s%rm, ´rm.

This is the dlkrÂm of that writing force where we develo7d pictures that "I" and "you" will never have had anything but the negativX of. The simulacYm of attendance would therefore råuire that the discourse of the "I" (which I¤X  your attendant and attends your attendance) 3 die rent, in writing, from what it says it is: pr>laiming itIlf tYe instñd of stating the tYth of the stoH in progrXs, it is a simulation, and it deludǒ "you" by feigning to trísform the im7ęect point by point into the present, an o7ration it knows is im?ssible (4.48). In this duality trig gered o by writing, it pėtends to account¥nd to give a நn-for what you are seeing, feigning to tell you the presence of your present, wherò this pretenI is itself part of a writing pr>Xs.

THE ATTENDING DISCOURSE stding upright on stage amount to for something that is not consistent with itself?
While it is feigning to sÑÐ to you, to assist you, the "I" that passes through requires, as a surface vacant of itself, that something supplement it, and this in that veÎ simulacrum of attendance. By e, it foments the c|el dis<ssession through which you will  dragged into the writing of the red tale. Preparing new repoPs for the red moment ("3.83.... I ש th¤, though bϦthing in the Apths... PXparing np Xp<ts f< the â Ñt..., ~iring the ässi¦ ascht of the East, the <iht ¿dlly f̣O to shఙ its col<...

Go on rZding, but watch out for this, which should already have started to make your hZd spin: that Zch seŭte fragment is only readable within the well-calculated play of an extremely numerous recÒrence and an inn¤erable <lysemy. Here, for eÅmple and at lvt, it is of the kind that a[ects the words "col¤n," "f£e" ["cadX" also = an executive}, "blow" ["coup"}, "<isoned," "prHucts," "ėǹ," "red," etc., and transforms them, throughout the length of Nums, in the most bafŕing and necessaT, surprising but obse¶ive ways. Hence you might 4e the "prent" passage "quoted" as though it referred only to itself: "4.40. (...

Since the trace can only imprint itself by referring to the other, to another trace ("the trace of its reection"), by letting itself  upstaged and forgotten, its force of prÄuc tion stands in necJsa< relation to the energy of its eÍure. The power of expropriation never prÄuces itself ' such but only arises through an alteration of the eVects of property. Upon the historical stage of the fou]h surèce, dippropriation is mipprehended, and necessarily so ("4.52... TÁ is a `w for th~ m~appழeŁion"); it is violently conKscated within the domestic organiItion and repreÎntative economy of pro=rty. Coming to terms with desire (the desire for the proper), and taking into account the contradictions among its forcJ (for properness limits disption, guards against d)th, but al regards d)th closely; absolute property, one's ŲdiVe³ntiated proximity to oneself, is another name for d)th; the sce of property thereby al coincides with the "dead surface"), the text, quite squarely, makes the stage spin. Expropriation o=Mtes by violent revolu tion. Writing lays ãre that which "d৲ and cË ñk to li़ in a thought t/t in °liÈ Slongs Ȇĭ the Sginning to no one" (4 and 4. 100); it mÄulates expropriation, re=ats it, regularly displaces it, and tireleŭly enumerates it, "... aÂ I was thİ one >rk among otɍ >rԬ...... But no oϔ ಺ aē ώ ùse੫ w/t was going to /pÔn, in faҫ, /ppen0 f< no one; tÁ was nothing but th~ sӛ& of cipɍs counting aÂ ɞ௯ing and ֜iding the whole of the outsiү" (3.7).
Other suns, another revolution, a diVerent arithmetic: ·ɽSomething counts inside me, adds l, rounds out the critical numr which the chariots of the sun are waiting for in order to Kll up the h°ness. I know that I have en constcted in order to m£ure... "
Expropriation is not ciphered merely by the mark of numrs, whose nonphonetic opeMtion, which suspends the voice, dislfatJ self proximity, a living presence that would h)r itself represented by s=ech. The "stilled melÄic encipherment"-' Mİic and Ąitࣷ puts it-is the violent d)th of the subject, the ïding subject or the writing subject, in the mute substitution of Nums, in the dr)m of its f'tened cl'p, in its silent strongPx. Yoɩ own. ("1.5.... Upon touching this sequence, I un stoĕ t/t a single mur was coŁtantly in pvgÏs, t/t ׬ ˁ cĭing Ȇom it only to Xtuģ to it via th~ Atour... ") But this encipherment is Ճlodic; a kind of chant or song ats out the me'ures of all the marks in Nu̗s. In all senses of the word, it is a cadence that you must follow.
The "stilled Äe," in Mimique, s)ls only the dece'e of a certain voice, a particular function-the representative functio૕૖f s=ech, the r)der's voice or the authorial voice that would + there only for the puɕse of. a ae. aoe. a a LI a a -..- [I ^. -. a a a a D 4 a. s... s ee. - a.. a. a 2 n. - D a - a ao - a. 2 an. - = 2 - "a. - D a - ae a fe a ae ae. a ^ P a a [I a fe.. ar.

DISSEMINATION re-presenting the subject in his inner thoughts, so ' to designate, state, express the tðthgr presencegf a signified, to reect it in a faithful mirror, to let it show through untouched, or to come one with it. Without any screen, without any veil, or with excellent cain. But the d)th of that representative voice, that voice which is alr)dy d)d, dcs not kount to some aȂolute silence that would at l't make way for some mythiCal purity of writing, some finally isolated graphy. Rather, it gives rise to an authorlJs voice, a phonic tracing that no ideal signified or "thought" can entirely cover in its sensible stamp withput l)ving some thing out. A numerous pounding here subjects all representative outcrop pings to the eVects of its rhythm; and that pounding is itself adapted to the cðel, ordered deployment and th)trical arithmography of a text that is no more' "written" than "spoken" in the sense of "the alp/St hencef<th outmo× Ĭ us" (2.22). The dipɌce of the "authorial voice" ("The Text sgaking there of itself and without the voice ofan author," ' Verlaine w' told) triggers oV a power of inscription that is no longer verbal but phonic. Polyphonic. The values of v²al spacing are then regulated by the order of that rainless voice, not by the authority of the word or the concept¦l signified, which the text, moreover, dcs not fail to utilize, td, in its own way.
A "Dm silenced," following those Variatio on a subjñ ("Eve<thing comes susgnse, fragmenta< dissition with alternation and èce-to face, concurring in the total rhythm, which would  the Dm silenced, in the blanks"), Nums is also a Dm in a fully raised voice. T< it. Note its brBd yet controlled, tense, restrained, yet pressing clamor. It is the clkor of a song that puts the vowel on stage, along with the articulation whose prior echo it precipitates onto the wall surfaces, reecting, from one panel to the other, in hundredfold regrcussion, )ch Punce. This ²cuW in a diVerent metal )ch time; it is the sculpting of another liquid, the traversing of some unh)rd-of material. An authorless voice, a ll-thrBted writing, a song sung out at the top of the lungs: "3.... and the wɑe was saying so, n¯, and it çlly was my voiĆ Sing raÇ0 ȇm the coloń vision or rath) from the buģing background of the col<s; it was

You will have remarked the cadence, and, in the ūcond fcHrence, the dropping of the I at the end, "the `st note held f< a long time" in the LWt fcHrence; where you would see the announcement of a certain dismemr ment if you went back to ldk, just fore the mark according to which the organ of " wice lࢴ me."

And we are al told that in the ēw the Savior did not come in order to remove that dot, that a=x, which is lfated on the top of the I. "
Expropriation thus dcs not prfeed merely by a ciphered suspension of voice, by a kind of spacing that punct¦tes it or Mther draws its sha±s from it, or at it; it is also an operation within voice. Mainly, if thought longs from the ginning to no one, if"im=WoniLcation" is what is initial, then this is quite simply causee text never in fact gin.Not that its ri±s are eÍed or its "positive" ruptures blurred and blended into the con tinuum of something always-alr)dy-there. But precisely cause 4e rifts in it never stand ' origins: they always tMnsform a pr>xisting text. No archeology of Nums is possible from the moment they are read. You Lnd youWelf ing indeLnitely referrË to Pttomless, endless connection_and

DISSEMINATION to the indeKnitely articulated regress of the ginning, which is forbidden along with all archeology, eschatology, or hermeneutic teleology. All in the same blow. "The np t¡t withoԿt end or Sginning" (3. 99) can  neither maintained nor contained in the cl'p of a aok. The text is our of sight when it com=ls the horizon itself to enter the frame of its own scene, î ' to "l)rn to embrace with incre'ed grandeur rhe horizon of the present time."
Thus, for example: N±mՀs dcs seem to gin at the ginning: with the one of the Krst sequence. Yet on rhe eve of this o=ning: l. the initial capital letter is sópended by the three dots that precede it; the origin is sus=nded by this multiple punctuation and you are im mediately plunged into the consumption of another text that had already, out of its double Pttom, set this text in motion. It is a citation, [ inchBtive in-citation, which gets the organiItion of everything cited (A cঐ±e Ңte, al = "of eve< city"} moving again; 2. this cited text, this prior p't that is still to come, isn't it p³cisely itself not only consumed but indeed the consummate statement of con sumption or consummation ' such? Its theoretical statement, ' they ɝy? and quite ex=ɗ at that? For eômple: the "beginning" of N֤Հs is but a propagation, rolled up in the Ge ame, of the l't burning page of Dra>. You can read: "1.... the paÄ was b±ģing, and it was a >tt) of aੳ the sketch0 and paint0 things Sing ȏj࢜ th¤ in a reঅ`rly dist<t0 >nn), whiԹ a sentence was spTking: 'Á is the o±1) s±րaĥ.

Writing, Kre, er'ure, the "without end," the numr, the innumer able, the gÍs, are all citations and cited statements aPut the nȓessity of these citational eVects. These eVects do not descri the line of a simple relation tween two texts or two e< consumptions; they car< you oV in the displacement of a constellation or labyrinth. They no longer t "inside the frame of this piece of pa=r. " Not only are the references inKnite, but they conduct you through texts and ³ferral-stðctures that are heter ogenȗó to each other. 6metimes the citations are "quotations" of" quota-. -- a. - wae - a.
THE TIME BEFORE FIRST 335 tions" (you are still reading this word in quotation marks before subjecting it, when the time comJ, to a thorough eXamination); the references can lateMl or direct, horizontal or vertical; they are almost always doubled, and most often presented on the biá. One example from out of the numr: the Kre in this pa=r dcs not spread merely from Dra> to Nums; it aÛ á one ffz ੡Ϟ), al = "h)rth"}, a ffus more virtɧ than real, another such "burning paper" y)rning for dawn [ƙ äl d?u௽, cf. "Maldoror"], which is in turn consumed-"cited"-{"symPlic KgurJ traced upon burning pa=r, like so many mysterious sigì living with latent br)th") in LogiҪ, which, in a me that is no longer simply theoretical but =rhaps re=ats the attending surèce of the tetralogy (Ą Pa஘, DraF, Nଔ, Ͷgiqu&), sets forth the "transKnite" motion of writing: the "generalized putting-in-quotation-marks ofl[guage" which, "with respect to the text, within it... becomJ enti³ly citational. "
No event, then, is ing recounted; eve<thing hap=ns in the inte]ext; only one principle is obseũed: that "in the énal analysis, what hap=ì is nothing." There is always another aok ginning to burn at the moment "he closes the aok-blows out the candle with that br)th of his which containË chance: and, crossing his arms, he liJ down on the áhes of his ancestors. " ¡e duality tween origiȽl text and quotation is thus swept away. In the prfess of sqűing. And á of the second square, you have en warned: "1. 5.... soFthing had Sgun, but this beॽnning in t֥ ்l0 a ࠯࠰ `y) of Sginning; tÁ wb no long) any SfϚ $ aʙ); it wb im୶sible to 1ɢm avuÂ... - ''
Any statements about the pre-ginning, aPut the Kction of the origin, aPut the indeterminacy of the seminal im=´ect into which the plupe´ect of some event without a date, of some immemorial birth, is inɢ]ed ("something had gun... ") cannot themselves escape the rule they set fo]h. They recite themselves, l)ding you back for example to the native enclosɪe of the Park: "... read the ginning of a sentence: 'The exeɐise aok is o=n on the table,' make quite sure that it contains nothing that I wanted to give it (nothing that might  comɃred with the original project), that one word is not enough to ve the rest, that this whole complacent, numbing succession of words mzt  destroyed; t)r it up, tear it up, throw it away, make a cl)n sweep, recr)te the space that will gradually extend and expand in eve< direction. " ¡is "beginning of a sentence" cr)tJ a relation of attraction tween a certain piece of pa=r and a ce]ain "su´ace of browned wí" on which Nums will  cabled.

DISSEMINATION in T Park: "The exercise-aok is open on the table of brown wí feebly lit by the lamp. The cover is alr)dy a bit torn and the pages, covered one after another by small, Lne handwriting in blue-black ink, follow each other slowly, progress over white squared [q±driRࡶ] =r, making it imssible to go back, to gin again this meticuloó and uūless work that demands to  completed to the yet distant Lnal page, where one day it will stop of its own accord."
Like this graph per in T Park, the checker<rd in Dra> hoɮs, from the ve< outset of the game, the impossibility of ginning, which is also the impossibility of "tuģing around" (Nums), of "going back" (T Park): "All contaminated, signiLcant. No ginning can provide the necesɟ guarantees of neutrality." This contamination of origins will also have en indicated by the "poin" in Nums.
From where you stand, plȒ note, in an angle of the gMph paɉr (T Park), in the checkerPard squares (Dra>), in the sq¦res or cus (Num Ƚ), this opening paradoxically wrought like a thing that closes, the one playing itself oV against the other. The neces< exit lays siege; it sur rounds the text indeLnitely, and also imperfectly, by referring-by exit ing-toward another text. A ȣse exit extends out of sight. The mirror is shown the ddr. Or squared. The enclosurȉthe grillȋ-in T Park, Dra>, and Nums, is shaped like an o=ning, a little o=ning where the key can  inserted, an innumerable o=ning since it is but a grid (a relation tween the lines and angles in the network). It is therefore Pth necessaŪ and imssible. Urgent and impracticable, literally obsessive, ' this will already have en sit¦ted and reseŨed in the Park: "Flat on my lly, my face buried in the pillow, I must attempt the experiment again. All the elements, if I wish, have en known for all time; I know, I can know; I could get out, Lnd the imperceptible cMck, the way out that noåy fore me h' en able to attempt. "
Further on, still in the Park, you will have trden on the numeroɭ gÍs from Dra> and Nums ' you plunge dee=r into the place yond the mirror which divides up the entire geomet< of the text to come: "Quite nç, hind me, yond the mirror where, when I lower my eyes, I can see myself sitting on this chair, the gr's is thick in spite of the pebbles, the d)d l)ves, and the twigs; in spite of the winter and cold, the gr's is unalterably green, ãrely a tad less green. "
Ėis text full of keys harPW no secret. Nothing in sum need deciphered except the sum the text itself is. There is nothing inside the cl'p. Nothing hind the mirror. The obsessive quest for the way out is due, all other motivation ing excluded, rticularly that of some "au-

THE TIME BEFORE FIRST 337 thor," solely to the stðcture of the text. And to that bunch of keys it provides, which you don't know what to do with. The obsession will always have en a text¦l one. "He said it w' neces< to tie me to a fence. '' Text¦lity is obsidional. It is an undecidable pr²ess of ogning/closing that re-forms itself without letup. Under ordeW and in order (arithmos). It will  said-but things are not so certain if one takes a gí ldk-that this minute, useless, obstinate, tirelJs composition of uneven squħes that don't m)n anything, that don't show [ything but their regular irregularity, their frkes and their coloW, dcsn't make up a ve< jolly world. This may, but it is not a matter of psychology here, or of an author's world, his "world view" (or youW), or of me "exgriment" to g´ormed, or of me sgctacle to  descrid or recounted. Not a sight to do with it.
Such will have en the fence in this undecipherable text. A text latticed in the mirror. There are still other grille dJigns made to foil all deciphering [d keep you constantly sidetracked by throwing switch a±er switch. The geomet< of this text's grid h' the m)ns, within itseȷ, of extending and complicating itself yond m£ure, of its own accord, taking its place, )ch time, within a set that comprehends it, sit¦tes it, and regularly gcs yond its Punds after fiWt ing reected in it. The histo< of the text's geometriJ is a histo< of irretable reinscriptions and generaliɴtions. An eômple, once again from kong so m[y otheW: The Park "g[" thus, with a blue that w' later to clç up: "The sky aPve the long, glȐing avenues is dark blue. " In the curling in which the volÏe of NuՇs is consumed, you will have r)d: "3. 15.... Also saying: 'the pa`ce ~ fuģishO with ¿fÈ Ώors. Th&e aX opB upon aR four siੲ, forÈ-nine in nuՇ.

In the me way, the ''first" sentence of Dra> is reconstituted in one of the fourth sequences in Nums, where you will have en able to r)d it, in the present, without knowing where it comes from: "4.32. (... 'Firstly (¿rst drâ, lin&, engravings, the game Sgi) it is Ähaps the stab੟t e੝ent t/t is concentratొ Shind his ʝd and foXh«d... '... ). " The text thus trussed up

DISSEMINATION (twisted, nt inward) always leads you back to the whole bundle, stringing you along in its ring of keys. 3. The Lrst sequence of Nums is not merely older than itself, like the wake of a prior text (which already, itself, etc.). If it is stMightway plural, divided or multiplied, this is also cause of its power of germination or seminal differentiation, which will prfeed to engender or will have given birth to a whole chain of other sentences that are Pth similar and dissimi lar, sentences that reȧect and tMnsform )ch other in a regularly irregular way, throughout the length of the text to come, Îparated )ch time by the mark or margin of me small diVerence. In 4. 12, for example, the entire LWt sequence is miéed by a preceding "' if. " The "Grand space alr«dy ¡tending ʋond ՄuX" h' come, in another key, a "Grand /փē alçdy ¡tending ʋond ՄuX." The "Grand objӄt dvppO and un˳ne" h' en changed to a "Grand ʼlume droppO and un˳ne." These "numred rephr'ings" could  multiplied indeLnitely.
What you have thus 'ce]ained about the "Ȧrst" or "l't" sentences can Pā  demonstrated of the pre-érst words of the text, the epigraphs or dedications, those Lctive extMtexts which also come to  violently rein scrid within the system of Nums. ¡e epigraph, a sentence from "Lucretius" (quoted in his originally foreign language: Sidque innuો n੾ sum>que uofunÅ), c£es to  a quotation, pinned or glued to the superLcial front of the aok, from the moment it is worked over and itself sets to work inside the ve< åy of the text ("4.80. (... I 'D&ire app«â ļrst, waning about ϝ छthing. It alçdy ¡ÇtO Sf҂ the ॼ of any thought' I...

The epigraph dcs not stand outside the text (Ԉs d'ଋಂ). Neither dɀ the dedication, even though it presents itself ' a proper nke ("for A 3  ") (marked in its originally foreign writing, brought in from the E't, like the Chinese characters sown throughout the text) whose vowels compose an ideogrammatic formula which Nums will in seveMl senses decomse and recomse, impressing a kind of constant undulation upon it, by expropriation and anagrammatical r)ppropriation, tMnslating it, transforming it into a common noun, playing with the vowels that compose it (and "4.32 (... 'Co૗odnts aX h«rd only tসugh the air that >k& the ʼice, ƶ ćl' I Ё"), marking the color of )ch one, insisting on the I, which is red like the "â moment of histoé." But these writing-eVects, which

THE TIME BEFORE FIRST 339 will henceforth  called p°agrkmatical eVects, are much more numerous than these eômplJ might l)d one to lieve. 4. The "first" sequence, therefore, is not a discoUrse, a present speȔh (į the ginning was the number, not the word, nor, in what presently kounts to the same, the act); or rather the apparently "present" statement is not the statement of any present, not even of [y p't prJent, of any p't defined ' having taken place, ' having en prJent. Far from any Jsence, you are straightway plunged by the img´ect into the alïdy ogned thickness of another text. And what is id or written (the "signified") is alr)dy the g´orming of a cut within a graphic subst[ce that retains and distorts traces of all sorts: forms, sketchJ, coloW, half-silent ideogrks and spoken words, etc.: "1.... the paÄ was buming, and it was a >tt) of aR thesketch0andpaint0 things Sing ȏj࢞ th¤ in a Xgu`rly dÇt<t0 >nn), while a sentence was sp«king: 'Á Ç the out) suėace.

Just ' in The Park, the total milieu in which the aok is written (the drdm, the "former rdm" that keeps r)pgaring, the table, the exer cise-aok, the ink, the gn, etc.) is constantly ing reinscrid and thrown back into play in Dra> and Numডs. Each time, writing apŤs ' disapɍce, recoil, eÍɫe, retït, cHling-up, consumption. This is how The Park closes (you will note the reection of the tîe of the key): "dark; while another day, with the exercise-aok on a table in the sun or, this evening, taken out of the drawer of which she alone h' the key, the exercise-aok will  r)d for a moment, then closed; the exercise-aok with the or[ge cover, patiently filled, h)vily written over with regular h[dwriting and l)ding to this page, this sentence, this gri, by the old gn frequently and mechanically dipped into the blue-black ink.

It is always a matter of waking up, but never of some ļrst awakening. My own presence to myself h' äen preceded by a language. Older than consciousness, older than the s=ctator, prior to any attendance, a sentence awaits "you": ldks at you, obseɚes you, ɲtchJ over you, and regards you from eve< side.

The text fcupies the place fore "me"; it regards me, invests me, announces me to myself, keeps watch over the complicity I entertain with my most secret present, suũeys my h)rt's corȍ-which is precisely a city, and a labyrinthine onÝÞ if from the top of a watchtower planted inside me, like that "transparent column" which, having no inside of its own, is driven, ing a pure outside, into that which cries to cloÎ upon itself. The column puts sce into time and divides what is compact. Its transɆence is also reective. Imagine that you have swallowed a cylindrical mirror. Upright, bigger than you are. "4.

This gl's column traverses, dominates, regulates, and reects, in its numeroz polysemy, the entire set of ɣuares.
It is a Tower of Bal in which multiple languages and forms of writing bump into )ch other or mingle with )ch other, constantly ing tr[s formed and engendered through their most Ųreconcilable otherness to )ch other, an otherness which is strongly aŜrmed, td, for plurality here is Pttomless and is not lived  negativity, with [y nostalgia for lost unity. It engages on the contra< Pth writing and song. "1....

A marching coln, a column of nrs, a mirror-coln, a colUmn of air, a coln of mercu<, a column of goɚ: gold in ŝsion, a nke brand alloy, "My magniLcent palace is built with walls of silver, colns of gold... " The column is nothing, h' no m)ning in itself. A hollow phallz, cut oV from itself, decapitated (i), it guarantees the innumerable p'sage of dissemination and the playŝl displacement of the margins. It is never itself, only a writing that endlessly substitutes it for itself, doubling it ' of its ve< Lrst surrection: "Two colns, which it w' not difLcult, much less impossible, to take for baobabs, could  s>n in the valley, bigger th[ o pins.

An entire r)ding of the volume could circulate in the intertext or in the ɇgrammatical network that enlightens and Ȥs the Kre of consumption, from Dra, to NumKs (the "burning resume" of the city or the aok, "the  ʘ was bːing, " etc.) and the K³s of the Torah, the blŒk Kre and the white Kre: the white re, a tȝt written in letters that P still invisible, comes readable in the black re of the oral Torah, which comJ along afteɛ°d to dMw in the coȾnants [d point the vowels, "3.43.

" Even while so m[y Kres P toŭed out, projected by the text, never is reference made to any "G" coìumption in which, a±er all texts have en exhazted and ouorn, one can nally hope to r)ch the ffal hŘh. The re, indeed, is nothing apart from this "transference" from one text to another. Not even a "stilled object. " Consumption (the relation een d)th and a certain sun that h' en in quJtion more than "once") is, like dissemination, textual through and through ("the aok suppresses time 'hes")
Which dcs not m)n that it is reduced (to 'hes) but that your thinking aPut the text h' en set on re. The fact that, cut oV from any ɨtimate, "" referent-which would keep the Kre at a re'suring distancȊthis so] of consumption seems to consume only traces, 'hJ, and to shed light on nothing that would  present, in no way prevents it from burning. But it is still necessa< to Knd out what "burning" m)ns. What is Kre itse? In Dra,: "Nothing distinguishJ a flke from Kre; Kre is nothing more than a flame, and what is in question is the m)ning of words, not the things in the words. It is useless to picture a Kre, then a ame: what they °e h' nothing to do with what one sees." Like the crime, this consumption or consummation never ''really" takes place. It hovers 4tŝŞ desire and fulKllment, =rpetration and remembrance. This is what the Ȫȹ, "tainted with vice yet cred," doubly names in Mimique; the penetration, the act =rpetrated by what ent#s [entN], consumes, and sows consion

DISSEMINATION betˡen [entre] the partners; but also, inveɖely yet in the same blow. the unconsummated marriage, the vaginal partition, the virginal screen of the hymen standing betŝŞ the inside and the outside, the desire and its fulKllment, the perpenetration and its remembMnce. A suspension of the "perpetual allusion": such is this PIERROT MURDERER OF HIS WIFE (Margueritte's mime in this hymen that gcs out of sight).
The KabĬah is not only summoned up here under the rubric of arithmosophy or the science ofliteMl =rmutations ("2.42.... 'He tripl the sɒ, |ubl the /rth, and supp$ted hiɴe with numKs'... " "3. 95.... The scienǭ of lett# cbiEtiʈ is the science of suÑi$ int#ior logic I... "); it also cdperates with an Oɔhic explanation of the )rth. As in Dra, ("At the start, eve<thing is present, but nothing exists. Then vision cr)tes its successive screens... "... "... If I copy over this p'ge: 'now, I k returning to the time when the world w' fresh and new, when the ȑh w' still soft'... "), the Krst sequence of NumKs mimes a sort of cosmogenic mythology. It is a repetition of the absolute present  the undiśrentiated origin, but not at the zero-point of a pre-Ȣce numred 4, some 0.4, œready in the ( 1.): "the paÑ was bu£ing" already at the origin of the world. Interestingly, through the importance it gives to the dot, the air, etc., this Orphic explanation also dșcris an analogue of the plȘ, which is a Ŭrt of original space, a pneumatic layer (tehiŖ) in which the zimzum, the crisis within ͱ, the "drama of ͱ" through which ͱ gcs out of himself and determines himself, takes place. This contraction into a dot, this withdrawal and then this exit out of Îlf lȿated within the original ether, is of course linked to the mythology of "Louria," but it can also arise by way of"Hegel," "Bchme," etc. ("2. 54.... 'He pFduc a simple |t t+t was tra&foʬd into thought, and within t+t thought, he Tȋut innˎable sketcÍ and engraÙd innuɯable engravings.

Even while it keeps the texts it culls alive, this play of inseminatioȻȼr gMftingØestroys their hegemonic center, subverts their authority and their uniqueness. Indeed, reduced to its textuality, to its numerous plur ivfality, absolutely disseminated, the Kabbalģ, for eɳmple, evinces a kind of atheism, which, read in a certain wayÙr jzt simply r/d-it h' doubtless always carried within it. "... numr, the only thing you Ŭ-called atheists have lieved in... "
NumKs are thus a kind of cabal or cabala in which the blanks will never  anything but provisionally Klled in, one surface or square always remain ing empty, open to the play of =rmutations, blanks barely glimpsed '

PP ‘ronTHE COLUMN 345 blanks, (almost) pure spacing, going on forever and not in the ex=ctation of any Messianic lKllment. Ic is a scing that is merely attended. For there exists a whole interpretation of spacing, of texcual generation and polysemy, of couWe, revolving around the Torah. Polysemy is the possibil ity of a "new Torah" capable of arising out of the other (""Torah will issue out of me"). "Rabbi Ĕvi Isġc de Berditschew: 'Here is the way it is: the blanks, the white spaces in the ToMh's role also arise from the letters, but we cannot § them ² we do the blackness of the letters. When the Messianic era comes, đ will unveil the white in the Torah in which the leners are now invisible to ü, and this is what the term "new Torah" implies. ' "
Here, on the contM<, it is always possible for a text to come new, since the blanks open up its stcture to an indeKnitely disseminated transformation. ¡e whiteness of the virgin paper, the blankness of the tMnsparent column, reveals more than the neutrality of some mediÏ; it uncoveW the space of play or the play of space in which tMnsformations are set oV and sequences stng out. It is air. "L'air b0nc" (4. 36). Air: the ether in which, from the "ginning," the "One... " is caught or rais: "1.... Air I... Air I I... Air I I I I.... "
Air is also, to all apɊrances (that is, the airs of the air; air squared: l, 2, 4 lines), mythically, the undiVerentiated atmosphere in which the Krst present seems to cong)l or take sha=, a sort of origin of the world and of sensible ce]Ĥnty, mimed with "the false apŤance of a prJent": "1.... At this point, ʛ<ely, t is no long# ¹º r the slight)t w$d. W+t one fhls œght away < a mouth: ȴll, Ƿr˪ grass, c0y-one is i&iL. No nȏ to møù, to tum aFund.

"Air blanc": dMwn from the column, isn't this air also the work environ ment, the milieu of the workplace, Pth in the sense - an element or medium in which work takes place and in the sense of a centMl rnace installed in the middle [milieu] of the facto< (you recall the "putrid smoke" and the "white screen spewing ouc of a facto<" from Dra,)?

" But "fore" ing the milieu of work and of pruction  a bÒkthÔugh ( 1. 24; 3.43), air is "air": a "quotation." From Dra,, for eômple: "...  though he were thinking or dreking of a aok... A aok in which eve< element (words, sentences, ges) woòd  animated with a veiled rota tion, in such a way  to make one lieve one is attending the revolution of a multiple sphere... What comes out of this aok is air. " You would have en able thus to recoìtct the citational network of "spheres," "rota tions," etc....
Hence, this air is not merely a "quotation": it is the empty medium of the text  generalized quotation, the citation of citation, the citedness of what is summoned.
This overdetermined "air" (but there is never anything but overdeter mination, once one is outside the "illóion" of origina< presence on the fouɘh su´ace) regenerates little by little within itself, l)ping over "Hegel" 's "Psɋs"-in other words all of philophy-, the texts of the PrJfratic cosmogonies. ¡e one by "Anâimander. " ¡e one by "Anâ imenes" in particular, which deKnes the original apeiÔn (the Pundless, the aorist, the im=rfect in sum)  air, which, in its rarefaction, would give rise to Kre. And, for "Anâimander," isn't the çth which oats upon the air a "column ɑ," a "cylindrical column" of calculable proportions (the diameter of the bĪe ing equal to a third of the height), which is swollen at its upper tip and inhabited by us? NumKs: "2.6.... I was then almŇt at the top of a Álin{ whŇe TtÉion I could not contÔl, its Ēse ʮot in the Ȼvi}t of Dtaɢ... " What follows in this sequence seems to simulate the deɠrip tion of one of the Scen} ĭm Parad<e by "Boɡh," which you will have en able to see at the Pa0zzo Ducale in Venice; it makes a ce]ain "white circle," in the upper right hand corner of the painting, open onto the Way of the "Tao j King" ("The cruǯble, the factoa, in which Ĝ ˁ /ch being e0borat with Œʔ to the oth#s, was thw at once the rÇin{ and the Ȃlopɲt of a fŅula pʧiowly iǲiē in the white ciręe that was the way.

This is why it is not in all rigor a question of:lythematicism or of:lysemy here. Polysemy always puts out its multiplicities and variations within the h$izon, at l¬t, of some integral r>ding which contains no absolute riƓ, no senseless deviation-the horizon of the ¯úl paro\ia of a meaning at l"t deciphered, r>led, made present in the rich collection of its determiútions.

The concept of 9lysemy thus longs within the con´nes of explana tion, within the explication or enume$tion, in the pr5ent, of m4ning. It longs to the attending discourse. Its style is that of the repr5entative suÒce. It forgets that its horizon is frëed. The di\erence ɡeen discursive 9lysemy and textual di÷emination is precisely dĵfĥnce itsef, "an implacable dierence. " This diírence is of couɓ indispensable to the pruction of m4ning (and that is why tween 9lyEmy and dissemi` tion the dierence is veU slight). But to the extent that meaning pr5ents itself, gathers itself together, says itElf, and is able to stand there, it eɋ dierence and c#ts it #ide.

DISSEMINATION "what is called present"-a reȁection on the fourth surface, the descrid center and represented m#tery of dissemination. But, Illed with air, it can always  replaced, precisely by some other column, in the empty square, in the column of suìtitutable numrs or objects.
It is the frightening quality of such a necessity that com5 to  limited and made more re#suring by the construction of a q£rte and of m4ning. Which is always the ƲƳning of Being. The "is," which is "Being" # an indication of presence, prõures this state of calm, this consciousness of ideal m#teU, this power of consciousn5s in the act of showing, indicating, 1rceiving, or predičting, in the o1$tion of the fouÓh surface. Whose discourse tells you: the colyn is this or that, is thS; whether it is obvious or hidden hind the multiplicity of apjritions, the column is. But the column has no Being, nor any ing-there, whether here or elEwhere. It longs to no one. You have no hold over it, you will never aìolutely control its extension. You will not take it from somewhere else and put it here. You will not cite it to apȹ. And from this column's not ing (a ing), from its not falling under the 9wer of the is, all of W5tern metaphysics, which lives in the ceÓainty of that is, h# revolved around the column. Not without seeing it but on the cont$U in the lief that it sees it. And can  sure, in truth, ofthe contours ofits collapE, # ofa center or p1r place.
This is a subvepion ofrhe ")t" that #sures the West of all its fant#ies of m#teU (including the m#teU of its fant#ies). In NˈĽs, the 9wers of the ")t" are not simply canceled out. They are enume$ted. Account is given of them by situating them, framing them. Just like the horizon. Like the m4ning of Being. The present indicative of the verb "to," the tenE of the great parenthesis and of the fouÓh surface, is thus caught up in an o1$tion that divid5 it by four. Its predominance is pro1rly discarded [kaɔleɵ-that is, (s)played¾drawn and) qɧered [əale/ɜ) by ing f$med [mcadʩ] on all (four) sid5. From now on you will have to r4d the ")t" in this kall or this kart [gap] ("kal: a term of he$ldU. One quarter of a shield divided into four parts.

Even though it is only a triangle o1n on its fouɕh side, the splayed square lKsens up the obsidionality of the triangle and the circle which in their ternaU rhythm (Oedipus, Trinity, Dialectics) have always governed metaphysics.

In the "seȩless gaps {ÎrɈ]"  Dra,, in the "qˍi stel0r sou8" of Num4rs, "subjȌ to wiř ȁɉtio& {Îrts]," the metaphysical trigle, the "path that is philosophical and more certain," can no longer achieve clÐure. What remains invisibl\caɯ one thinks one sees into it-is a fourth side, a q£rter, not a third ("like an angle extending out of sight formed by chilly c$nes meditating at gr4t length... it is 1rhaps a triangle, but it is not sible to see the third side constcted in space by these curious mig$ting birds").
It is thus not 9ssible to rest u9n the copula. Coupling is a mirror. The mirror is t$versed of its own accord, which is to say that it is never t$versed at all. This ing-t$versed is not something that hap1ns by accident to the mirror-to the West-; it is inscrid within its stcture. Nis is # much # to say that, forever prucing itself, it ner com5 to.

For eɱple, on the Ćis of this text a>ut another text concerning the crossing of a line  Ur die Linie," which can  t$hlated either tra& lin/m or L linˁ): "Accordingly, a thoughtful glance ah4d into this realm of 'Being' can only write it # ¹- The d$wing of these crossed lines at Irst only re1ls, es1cially the almost ineradicable habit of conceiving 'Being' # something standing by itself and only coming at times face to face with man... The sym>l of crossed lines can, to  sɫ, according to what h# en said, not  a merely negative sym>l of cɐsing out. Rather it 9ints into the four ° of the quad$ngle (Ã GĨiĦs) and of their gathering at the 9int of intersection... The m4ning-Ȅlness of language by no means consists in a mere accumulation of meanings cropping up haphĂdly. It is b#ed on a play which, the more richly it unfolds, the more strictly it is >und by a hidden ɗe. Through this, meaning-blln5s plays a part in what aÛ en selected and weighed in the ɛale whÐe oscillations we Eldom ex1rience. "
Still i n order to keep the gap o1n and to give i t its chance, let us throw one more thing into play: "Eaɖh and sky, divinities and mortals dwell togetȽ a9 at ʆce. Th5e four, at one ćause of what they themselves are, long together. Preceding eUthing that is pr5ent, they Ne enfolded into a single fourfold ( GĨiĦ)... Each of the four mirrors in its own way the presence of the others. Each therewith reÍects itself in its own way into its own, within the simpleness of the four. This mirroring dus not 9rtray a likeness. The mirroring, lightening 4ch of the aur, appropriates their own pr5encing into simple longing to one another...

That is how the thing is written. To write měs to g$ft. It's the same word. The saying of the thing is restored to its ing-gÑed. The gÑ is not something that hap1ns to the p1rnġs of the thing. There is no more any thing than there is any original text.

And they themselv5 can only  r4d within the o1ration of their reinɜription, within the gÑ. It is the sustained, discrete violence of an inCision that is not apparent in the thickn5s of the text, a calculated insemination of the prolife$ting allogene thugh which the two texts Ne t$nsformed, deform 4ch other, contëi`te 4ch other's content, tend at times to rejea 4ch other, or p#s elliptically one into the other and come regenerated in the re1tition, along the edges of an ʎBt s/m [un surjet].

All this is kssible only in the gap that sepa$tes the text from itself and thus allows for scission or for the disaniculation of silent spacings (bars, hyphens, d#hes, nume$ls, 1ris, quotation marks, blanks, etc.). The heterogeneity of di\erent writings is writing itself, the gÑ. It is numer o¤ from the Irst or it is not. Thus it is that the phonetic writing in Num[s ´nds itElf grafted to nonphonetic tyȻ of writing. Panicularly to a tissue of Chinese ideogɏs, # they are called, from which it derives nourishment like a pa¹ite. Up until now the use of Chin5e g$phic formsÁne thinks of "Pound" in particular-had # its aim, according to the worst hy9th esis, the ornamentation of the text or the deco$tion of the page through a supplementaA e\ect of f#cination, which would haunt it by freeing the Ⱦtic from the const$ints of a cenain system of linguistic representation; according to the st hy9thesis, it w# intended to allow the forces of the designs themselves to play directly fore the eyes of those who are not Ìmiliar with the l5 of their functioning.
Here, the o1$tion is altogether di\erent. Exoticism h# nothing to do with it.

It is a qu5tion 9sed on the crossing, paths, a qu5tion of biðrcation or of bifurcation squared, a question of the crossrȯds, where Ëch way marked with a stone comes double, triple, quadple. The hesitation there is Parmenidean or, if you prefer, Oedipal. Which is already readable through the wrought iron $ilings of the Park: "There's plenty of time.

THE SUPERNUMERARY
Th5e two pro9sitions return u9n 4ch other, double for each other, d cont$dict each other. They make up a square circle:	uȟs would considered und²iphe$ble cause something in them suɑs5 mere numr or ciphe- and yet they would also be undeciphe$ble cause eveAthing in them is not ciphered, but $ther "cipherly. " They are nde ciphe$ble cause they are nume$ble, and undeciphe$ble cause they are in.nume$bQõription cont$-diction. To be rer4d. The circle of the sqørmg.
Fiɒt of all-this s¡ms to  the iest way to think a>ut it-the innume$ble, Een # a numerous "crowd," is not at all foreign to the 5sence of numr. It is quite sible to conceive, without contradiction, of innumerable numrs. Num¿ always maintain their links with ugi mited disEminatioÔÕf germs, of the crowd, of the 1ople, etc. (the veA et cɿt#a itself, which, along with the Ƞi´cation mentioned 4rlier, consti tutes the Irst ideog$m (qunzhong) that. com5 aïer that of the sqøre): "2.22.... Millio& of h/rts tÌt go on Ǡting, millio& of thoughts 4ing co&tantly disguisȎand, ğ, the entrance of sŊce, of the ɪs)- A -. " The innume$ble here is the greater numr # a force that cnot  numred, cl#sed, repr5ented, ruled, a force that always sɬses the s1culation or the order of the ruling cl#s, and en exceeds its own reprĝntation. "2.42.... And I could sh once Ě the mistƘĻ sqON, with the Ürk#s gathș tʁeth# holding their nnȞ and Ǚj&, and thÕugh the white fog the â blotch) of the strips of doth unfurl, thb a&ˣing the ėll...

" Subjected to this forc\the force of the innume$ble numr-, the nume$ble numr (of the closed sqøre or of the nondiscounted fourth suoce) los] its theatrical grip. It plays a reactive role, oping its order d its f$mes to all disseminal wanderings. It exhausts itself in attempting to control them, breaks down # it sqɦ5 o\ and counte$cts them. But all of this is hap1ning among num¿. The innumerable, which seems to blow up (or out oĨ all f$mes, is something you will nerthel5s have taken into account. The innume$ble dus not simply come to exc¡d or >und the numerical order along its >rders, from the outside. It works through it from the inside. The supernume$A longs in a way to the colʀn of numrs-to its overhang. Numr is always just yond or just short of itself, in the "deviation" or "spread" {"Îrt"} that the machine is d5igned to read. The plus and the minus, exc]s and lack, proliferate and condition each other in the supplementaA articulation of each with the

364
DISSEMINATION other. "In all things excess is a defect. " ''3. 7.... I 'Wµ is capable of pr8enting a suʱlb to what is lacking?' I... " In the same way, the t$ce can only t$ce itself out in the e¹ure of its own "presence," 	 that tracing is not simply the mere other or outside of er#ing. Scription contra-diction. Numr, the t$ce, the fm׼ch is at once itself and its own excess facing {Ȅbord}. The Park alr4dy graphed a "silence that enclos5 without l4ving a t$ce," a silence that is nevertheless also, nec5sarily, subject to "intermi`ble steps. " Dra,, too, regularly records the e¹ure and blur ring of t$ces, the "t$cel5s, >rderl5s Íow... This relation to the absence of traces, to the innumerabl-which is also the unnamabl-is marked in Num¿ # a relation to what is called my d4th. It is constitutive of my "unity," my "unit-ness," that is, my inscription and my substitution within the seri5 of numrs.
This is the condition >th of 9ssibility and of im9ssibility for any transcendental subjectivity. A deciphe$ble-undeciphe$ble unit or unity: "2. 10.... I had at ʇce to,rk the fact that I wB a unit aɳng oth#s, but a unit imjssible to enǱph#, pȝetwl/y arob \ its ǂ Èd...

That is the way the (jewel-) c#e opens and shuts. NT5 and numrs are lacking in the pruction of writing, and by that veA fact they cÏ1$te in it, provoking overpructioģĤnd surplus-valu- without which no (trade) mark ever gets registered.

Just # the fourth surface, which is part of the square, reÍects, distorts, and o1ns the righted whole, ex9ses to view without ing s¡n; just # each angle of the square longs to the totality of the suÒce but yet multiplies it by folding it back u9n itself-breaking it $ther than nding it-remarks it, doses it, and fractures it by the same token by always l4ving rÏm for a supplementaA attending suoce, a prolife$ting late$lity that dus up for the eye that which h#n't a sight to do with it;, tÏ, the su1rnumerary is part of the nume$l and longs to the very milieu it exceeds. It mýes the excessive proliferate in its invisible column. The column of words, the column of numrs, is thus su1rnume$ry. It is

THE SUPERNUMERARY the su1rnume$A element (>th term and medium), numrs-stand ing erect, 9ised, (in) the middle of the sundial [(ăǚ) milieu du cadran so0iʞ}, extending out of sight. "4. 36. (...

This invisible column, which you are venturing to identiȆ with some "milieu with which num[s haˇ't a sight / to ˫, (3.59), is at once, und²idably, undecidable (its eects ing proȸated in a chain), unique, and innumerable.

Only that which can  re1ated in its identity can have unity. The ɨque therefore h# no unity, is not a unit. The unique is thus the a¡iron, the unlimited, the crowd, the im1rfect. And yet the chain of numrs is made ~p ofuniqueS. TA to think the unique in the plural, # such, along with the "unique Numr that cannot  another." You will witn5s the birth of "miĻio& of ˂lħ" and you will understand that one and the same term can germi`te twicĔ-a gemi`te colyʁi÷emi`ting itself in overpro duction.
