search. But this same search begins a progressus ad indefinitum, because it is the will to perfection in each subject matter, whereas perfection aims precisely at domains other than that in which it wishes to realize itself: under these conditions, the aesthetic quest cannot find stable norms, since it is driven by negative characteristics, which is to say by the feeling that a mode of thought discounts other modes of thought that are equally valid: the tendency of aesthetics is the endeavor to realize an equivalence of all other domains within a single determinate domain; the more particular and specialized a domain is, the more aesthetic requirements push for the construction of a perfect work, this perfection being a will to overcome itself in order to be equivalent to other domains and in order to realize them through an overabundance of this local accomplishment: as if this local perfection, radiating and overflowing superfluity, had the power to be what this domain is not.

Art is thus will to universality, will within a particular being to surpass its mode and realize all the modes within its own through a surpassing of its limits: perfection is not a fully realized normativity of limitation, but the discovery of an excellence so great, functioning within itself and reverberating within itself with such plenitude that it attains all other modes and would be capable of rendering them by way of an impoverishment. There is, in fact, an illusion in the aesthetic enterprise, since it is perhaps impossible that a determinate mode of thought can be equivalent to all the others by virtue of its perfection. Aesthetic intention, however, contains the affirmation of the possibility of this overcoming, of this equivalence or this mutual convertibility of excellences. Art is a quest for a concrete excellence, engaged in each mode and with its sights set on finding the other modes through the movement of a mode within itself; this is how art is magical: it aims at finding modes without going outside a mode, only by dilating it, reworking it, and perfecting it. There is magic because there is a supposition of a reticular structure of the real universe; each mode magically exceeds itself while staying objectively within itself. This presupposes that the other modes are also subject to the same internal quest: it is not the stability of a mode that communicates with the stability of another, but excellence with excellence, aesthetic intention with aesthetic intention.

One could say, once again referring to the word transductivity, that art is what establishes the transductivity of the different modes in relation to each other; art is what remains non-modal in a mode, just as around an individual there remains a pre-individual reality associated with it and enabling it to communicate in the institution of the collective.
