information channel in the Watt governor, a channel of counter-reaction (feed-back), but this information is transmitted through a channel that is not distinct from the one used by the motive power that allows the engine to move a resistant organ: the regulator is connected to the output shaft; the whole ensemble made up of the fly-wheels, the main shaft, the volumetric cylinder device and then the system for transforming alternating movement into circular movement must therefore already have slowed down through the loss of its kinetic energy so that the regulator can intervene by increasing the admission time of the engine and consequently also its power. Now, there is a serious drawback in this lack of distinction between the motive power channel (the energy channel) and the feedback channel (the information channel), which greatly reduces the effectiveness of regulation, and the extent of the individualization of the technical being: when the engine slows down (which is necessary in order for the regulator to come into action), the decrease in running speed causes a decrease in power (the engine power, in low or medium working conditions [regime], where the throttling of steam in the sliding valve does not come into play, is proportional to the sum of all the elementary work performed by successive piston strokes in a unit of time). The decrease in angular speed results in the deterioration of the very conditions of reactivity that the regulator is designed to provoke.

It is this lack of distinction between the energy channel and the information channel that marks the thermodynamic age, and constitutes the limit of the individualization of thermal engines. Suppose on the contrary that a gauge measures the torque on the transmission shaft at the outlet of a heat engine at every moment, and that the result of this measurement is sent back to steam intake (or fuel intake or carburized air-intake if it is an internal combustion engine), so as to increase steam-intake in relation to the increased resistance exerted on the transmission shaft; the pathway by which the resistance measurement then is fed back into the steam supply and modifies it is thus distinct from the energy channel (steam, cylinder, piston-rod, crank shaft, axle, transmission shaft); there is no need for the engine to slow down for its power to increase: the information sampling rate along the information channel can be extremely high with respect to the time constants of the energy channel, for instance one every few hundredths or a few thousandths of a second, while the cycle of a stationary steam engine lasts about a quarter of a second.

It is therefore natural that in machines, the advent of the use of information-channels that are distinct from energy channels caused a very profound change in the philosophy of technics. This advent was conditioned by the development of the
