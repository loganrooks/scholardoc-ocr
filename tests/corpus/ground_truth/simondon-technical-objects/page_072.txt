which the technical ensemble had arrived at, and which, in turn, can be reunited to enable the construction of new technical beings in the form of individuals; there is thus no engendering here, no procession or direct production, but only indirect production through the constitution of elements that contain a certain degree of technical perfection.

This affirmation requires that we specify what the process of technical perfection is. Empirically and externally one can say that technical perfection is a practical quality, or at the very least the material and structural basis of certain practical qualities; in this way a good tool is not simply one that is well put together and well crafted. In practical terms an adze can be in poor condition, blunt, and yet not be a bad tool; an adze is a good tool if, on the one hand, it has a curve suited for a straight, well aimed strike at the wood, and, on the other hand, if it can be sharpened and keep its sharpness even when employed to work on hard wood. This latter quality in turn results from the technical ensemble employed to produce the tool. It is because it is a fabricated element that the adze can be made of a metal whose composition varies at different points; this tool is not only a hunk of metal shaped into a certain form; it has been forged, which is to say that the molecular chains of the metal have a certain orientation that varies in certain places, like a piece of wood whose fibers are oriented in the direction that offers the greatest solidity and elasticity, especially in the intermediary parts between the cutting edge and the flat thick part which goes from the socket to the cutting edge; this region close to the cutting edge deforms itself elastically during work, because it acts as both wedge and lever on the piece of wood being chipped off. And finally, the cutting edge has a higher steel content than the other parts; its steel needs to be hard, but in a proper delimited way, for too much of hard steel in the cutting edge would make the tool brittle and the edge would shatter into splinters. It is as if, in its totality, the tool was made of a plurality of functionally different zones, welded together. The tool is made not only of form and matter; it is made of elaborate technical elements according to a certain schema of functioning and assembled into a stable structure through the operation of fabrication. The tool unites within itself the results of the functioning of a technical ensemble. In order to make a good adze a technical ensemble of a foundry, forge, and quench hardening is required.

The technicity of the object is thus more than a quality of its use; it is that which, within it, adds itself to a first determination given by the relation between form and matter; it acts as an intermediary between form and matter, here for instance as the progressive heterogeneity of the quench hardening in different points. Technicity is the degree of the object's concretization. During the period of wood foundries, it
