There is a big theoretical and practical difference between these two cases; if the supply is indeed simply stabilized without a recurrent causal link with the oscillators, then simultaneous utilizations of this supply can be limited or extended without inconvenience; it is then possible to plug a third oscillator into the same supply without disturbing its functioning, provided the normal limits of output are not exceeded; however, in order to obtain an efficient feedback regulation the exact opposite is required: no more than a single structure can be attached to a single associated milieu; otherwise opposed random variations in two structures that are linked non-synergistically with the same milieu might compensate for one another rather than resulting in a regulatory reaction; the structures attached to the same associated milieu have to function synergistically. For this very reason the audiometer comprises at least two distinct parts that cannot be stabilized by the same associated milieu: the frequency generator on the one hand and the amplifier-fader on the other. An action by one of these ensembles on the other must be avoided, which notably leads to the careful separation of both their power supplies and to electrically and magnetically shielding the partition that separates them, in order to avoid any interaction. The material limit of the audiometer, however, is not a functional limit; the amplifier-fader is normally extended by way of the acoustic transducer and by the room or external ear of the subject, depending on whether or not one employs speakers or headphones for coupling with the subject. Henceforth, one can posit the existence of relative levels of individualization of technical objects. This criterion has an axiological value: the coherence of a technical ensemble is at its maximum when this ensemble is constituted by sub-ensembles with the same level of relative individualization. In a laboratory of physiology of sensations there is thus no advantage in grouping the audiometer's two oscillators together with the amplifier-fader; however, it is worth grouping the two oscillators together so that both are affected simultaneously and in equal proportion by any variation in voltage or temperature, so that the variation of the lower frequency of the beat, which will result from the two correlated variations of the frequency of each of the oscillators, should be as low as possible, given that the two basic frequencies will rise or fall at the same time. It would be perfectly contrary to the functional unity of the beat-frequency generator, however, if two separate power supplies were used and if one oscillator were plugged into one phase of the mains and the other into another phase. One would thereby cancel the self-stabilizing effect of compensation between two variations, which gives the ensemble of the two oscillators its great stability in low beat frequencies. On the other hand, it becomes useful to plug the oscillators into a mains phase different from the one
