transparent system of difference, a "fact," as Lévi-Strauss says, with which
"we are then confronted" (p. 9) [p. 8]; or is rather the origin of the dif-
ference between nature and culture, the condition—outside of the system
—of the system of difference. The condition would be a "scandal" only
if one wished to comprehend it within the system whose condition it
precisely is.
Let us suppose then that everything universal in man relates to the natural
order, and is characterized by spontaneity, and that everything subject to a norm
is cultural and is both relative and particular. We are then confronted with
a fact, or rather, a group of facts, which, in the light of previous definitions, are
not far removed from a scandal: . . . [for] the prohibition of incest . . . presents,
without the slightest ambiguity, and inseparably combines, the two character-
istics in which we recognize the conflicting features of two mutually exclusive
orders. It constitutes a rule, but a rule which, alone among all the social rules,
possesses at the same time a universal character (p. 9) [pp. 8–9].

But the "scandal" appeared only at a certain moment of the analysis;
the moment when, giving up a "real analysis" which will never reveal any
difference between nature and culture, one passed to an "ideal analysis"
permitting the definition of "the double criterium of norm and universal-
ity." It is thus from the confidence placed in the difference between the
two analyses that the scandal took its scandalous meaning. What did this
confidence signify? It appeared to itself as the scholar's right to employ
"methodological tools" whose "logical value" is anticipated, and in a state
of precipitation, with regard to the "object," to "truth," etc., with regard,
in other words, to what science works toward. These are the first words—
or nearly so—of Structures:

It is beginning to emerge that this distinction between the state of nature and
the state of society (today I would rather say state of nature and state of culture)
while of no acceptable historical significance, does contain a logic, fully justify-
ing its use by modern sociology as a methodological tool [p. 1] [p. 3].

This is clear: in regard to the "chiefly methodological value" of the con-
cepts of nature and culture, there is no evolution and even less retraction
from Structures to The Savage Mind. Nor is there either evolution or re-
traction with regard to this concept of methodological tool; Structures
announces most precisely what, more than a decade later, will be said of
"bricolage," of tools such as "means" "collected or retained on the principle
that 'they may always come in handy.'" "Like bricolage on the technical
plane, mythical reflection can reach brilliant unforeseen results on the
intellectual plane. Conversely, attention has often been drawn to the
mytho-poetical nature of bricolage" (pp. 26 f.) [pp. 17–18]. To be sure,
it would still remain to be asked if the anthropologist considers himself
