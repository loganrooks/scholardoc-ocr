in principle renders absurd the so easily admitted notion of the "sensible
signifier"), or understood as the ideal synthesis of signifieds or a trace
operative on another level, or whether it is understood, more profoundly, as
the passage of the one to the other—has never been absolutely linked with
a phonetic production. Within cultures practicing so-called phonetic writ-
ing, mathematics is not just an enclave. That is mentioned by all historians
of writing; they recall at the same time the imperfections of alphabetic
writing, which passed for so long as the most convenient and "the most
intelligent" 4 writing. This enclave is also the place where the practice of
scientific language challenges intrinsically and with increasing profundity
the ideal of phonetic writing and all its implicit metaphysics (metaphysics
itself), particularly, that is, the philosophical idea of the epistémè; also of
istoria, a concept profoundly related to it in spite of the dissociation or
opposition which has distinguished one from the other during one phase
of their common progress. History and knowledge, istoria and epistémè
have always been determined (and not only etymologically or philo-
sophically) as detours for the purpose of the reappropriation of presence.
But beyond theoretical mathematics, the development of the practical
methods of information retrieval extends the possibilities of the "message"
vastly, to the point where it is no longer the "written" translation of a
language, the transporting of a signified which could remain spoken in its
integrity. It goes hand in hand with an extension of phonography and of
all the means of conserving the spoken language, of making it function
without the presence of the speaking subject. This development, coupled
with that of anthropology and of the history of writing, teaches us that
phonetic writing, the medium of the great metaphysical, scientific, techni-
cal, and economic adventure of the West, is limited in space and time and
limits itself even as it is in the process of imposing its laws upon the
cultural areas that had escaped it. But this nonfortuitous conjunction of
cybernetics and the "human sciences" of writing leads to a more profound
reversal.

The Signifier and Truth

The "rationality"—but perhaps that word should be abandoned for
reasons that will appear at the end of this sentence—which governs a writ-
ing thus enlarged and radicalized, no longer issues from a logos. Further, it
inaugurates the destruction, not the demolition but the de-sedimentation,
the de-construction, of all the significations that have their source in that of
the logos. Particularly the signification of truth. All the metaphysical
determinations of truth, and even the one beyond metaphysical onto-
theology that Heidegger reminds us of, are more or less immediately
inseparable from the instance of the logos, or of a reason thought within
the lineage of the logos, in whatever sense it is understood: in the pre-
